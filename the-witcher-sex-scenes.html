Setting the show's nudity level high from episode one, we see Stregbor in his mansion in the middle of a magical sexual illusion. Surrounded by supple naked young women who are picking apples from the garden of Eden.</p><p>Paying no interest to the prized carcass, Stregobor wants to share a story about The Curse of the Black Sun - a curse that primarily affects princesses and can sway them to the dark side.</p><p>He shares this with The Witcher as he expects him to look for a princess named Renfri, who is under the curse's influence and is out looking for him.</p><p>Geralt doesn't want to concern himself with this and disagrees with killing the princess. However, later in the episode, Geralt runs into Renfri in the woods, where she shares her side of the story.</p><p>The Witcher claims that there is no lesser evil and manages to convince her to leave the town of Kovir.&nbsp;</p><p>Coming around to his way of thinking, their tension increases and the pair end up having sex out in the woods.&nbsp;</p><p>More nudity is seen in the brief illusion than during their escapade in the woods.</p><p>After their physical engagement, Geralt gets visions of Renfri telling him about "a girl in the woods who is his destiny."&nbsp;Renfri leaves in the morning and with the events that follow, Geralt acquires the title of The Butcher of Blaviken.</p><p>Episode two focuses more on character development than that of sexual voyages. In particular we learn more about Yennefer, a witch who pops up more and more as the series goes on.&nbsp;</p><p>Episode 3, however, doesn't disappoint as it delivers more body contact.</p><p><strong>Season 1 Episode 3 A Mere Coincidence</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000700638120.jpg><p>Episode 3 starts with a tease of Geralt's sexual conquests.</p><p>The episode opens with a scene where Geralt is in bed with a prostitute.</p><p>The prostitute is pivotal to moving the story forward. With a flash of some frontal nudity the lady of the night tells him of another Witcher who fled from Temeria after being challenged by a beast that is haunting King Foltestâ€™s kingdom.</p><p>Geralt sets out to Vizima to deal with this beast himself.</p><p><strong>Season 1 Episode 3 Power and Acceptance</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000700638183.jpg><p>Later in the episode, things start to heat up.</p><p>Having been introduced more to Yennefer, her tragic past, and the events that help shape who she is now as a magical being, we start to see her relationship with The Witcher and other vital characters grow.&nbsp;</p><p>Unknowingly teleporting herself, she meets Istredd for the first time, a well-respected sorcerer in the city of Aedd Gynvael.</p><p>Istreed tells Yennefer that the sorceresses of Thanedd Island will now start looking for her.&nbsp;</p><p>After being taken away to the Island by a supreme sorceress Tissaia de Vries, Yennefer is put through her paces and hones her skills.</p><p>We see through the series that she meets Istredd repeatedly. Istredd eventually makes her believe in herself and accepts her the way she is.</p><p>As the episode goes on, we see the relationship between the two blossom, and we see the pair make love. The tastefully shot sex scene shows full nudity and shows Yennefer's need to be in control.</p><p><strong>Season 1 Episode 5 The Last Wish&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000700638121.jpg><p>Due to the season's non-linear timeline, you have to keep your wits about you when watching, but by this point, Geralt and Jaskier were able to get their hands on a sealed amorpha and can conjure a djinn.</p><p>Of course, things don't go to plan, and the djinn tries to strangle the Bard.</p><p>Needing magical assistance, Geralt takes him to Yennefer, who uses her unworldly power to cure him, and the Bard falls into a deep, restful slumber.</p><p>During his nap, the pair share a very steamy and sensual moment in a bathtub (the scene later referred to as Tub Geralt). Yennefer, clearly satisfied, says that his company was enough to pay for what she did for Jaskier.</p><p>The rest of the episode is very provocative, including full frontal nude scenes where Yennefer tries to bind the djinn with her magic.</p><p>Unfortunately, Yennefer is unaware that the djinn was granting Geralt's wishes and not Jaskier's.</p><p>Later, she forces Geralt to make his final wish to the djinn; yes, they are basically evil genie monsters. Geralt realises that the djinn will only kill Yennefer if he does not do something about it.</p><p>With this, Geralt makes his final wish, and the djinn leaves them under the rubble of their Inn.</p><p>This event causes the two to ravage each other and make love in the debris lustfully.</p><h4>Season 1 Episode 6 A Consequence</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000700638251.jpg><p>As time lines and stories cross, so do Yennefer and Geralt once again.</p><p>This time around, though, they let loose on how they actually feel about one another.</p><p>Fans will know that witchers are meant to be void of any feelings or emotions, but yet he courageously tells Yennefer how much he missed her.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Yennefer confesses she feels the same, leading to the couple making love again in an intimate scene.</p><p><strong>The Witcher Season 2 lands globally on Netflix Friday, 17 December</strong></p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun Showbiz team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSBc4SUcmdrZ6Sdsm7DyK2aoZ2iYsCmxIysmp6mlah8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-witcher-sex-scenes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-witcher-sex-scenes.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-witcher-sex-scenes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-witcher-sex-scenes.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-witcher-sex-scenes.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-witcher-sex-scenes.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./disney-stars-through-the-years-2011269.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./disney-stars-through-the-years-2011269.html>Disney Stars Through the Years: Lindsay Lohan and More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./zv6hmariwaa4ierbwxl5cu-lykn4nj12.html>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./zv6hmariwaa4ierbwxl5cu-lykn4nj12.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
