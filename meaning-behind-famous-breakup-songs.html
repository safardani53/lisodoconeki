Regardless of who the heartbreaker was, Adele told the audience at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Royal Albert Hall</a> in 2011 that she had a soft spot for him and now that they're on better terms, she looks at the time they spent together quite fondly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This next song I'm going to do changed my life when I wrote it and when I first sang it," she said. "I know it's a break up record and I'm really b---y on it, but the guy who it's about changed my life and we were so in love and we had so much fun. It was brilliant, our time together ... As bitterly as it ended ... I forgive him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Who can blame her, considering what a hit it became? "When I was writing it—I had eight songs on the album—but I didn't have one sing that I believed myself on," she continued. "I wrote this and I was very proud of it and I knew it would resonate with people."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-i-will-always-love-you--dolly-parton></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>"I Will Always Love You" — Dolly Parton</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The tale of "I Will Always Love You" is a storied one. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dolly Parton</a> first wrote the song in 1973 as a farewell to Porter Wagoner, who had been her longtime colleague and mentor. At the time, Parton was leaving their group in pursuit of a solo career.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The country ballad was a hit, going number one on Billboard Hot Country Songs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Years later, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Elvis Presley</a> heard the song and wanted to record it for himself, but Parton couldn't agree to the terms his team offered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Elvis loved the song, that was when he and Priscilla were having their problems," she explained while on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Big Interview</a>. "But during that time—and it's no fault of Elvis'—but Tom Parker, his manager…calls me the day before and says, 'Now you do know that Elvis is recording your song and Elvis don't record anything that he don't publish or get half publishing on."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This would mean that Parton would have had to give up all or at least half her publishing rights to Presley, a deal she simply couldn't strike.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I said, 'I can't do that. This song has already been a hit with me, this is in my publishing company and this is obviously going to be one of my most important copyrights. I can't give you the copyrights.'" The recording session was canceled and the King of Rock and Roll never revisited the ballad.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As fate would have it, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kevin Costner</a> requested that Whitney Houston sing it on The Bodyguard soundtrack. Her interpretation of the song as a soulful ballad was a massive smash hit, breaking the record at the time for most weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Does it bother Parton that many think of Houston's rendition as the definitive one? Not at all, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she told Katie Couric in 2016</a>: "A lot of people say, 'Oh, that's Whitney's song.' And I say, 'That's fine, she can have the credit, I just want the cash!' " (She also later revealed that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>she used the profits to build an office complex in a historical Black area of Nashville to benefit the community</a>.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-thank-u-next--arianna-grande></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>"Thank U, Next" — Arianna Grande</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Ariana Grande in&nbsp;Thank U, Next.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some stars play it coy when it comes to who inspired their breakup songs.

"He was like 'Dang, I'm the first one huh?' and I said, 'I mean, I went kind of in order,'" she joked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Grande also revealed that Ricky Alvarez had a bit of a bone to pick with her about her choice of lyrics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was like, 'Why'd I get the worst line?...Everyone else's line is so nice and mine is like 'F--- him he's trash'," she recalled.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>publicly told him the line (which was changed to "wrote some songs about Ricky/now I listen and laugh) was meant "v lovingly"</a> and later said all her exes were very supportive of the song.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-survivor--destinys-child></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>"Survivor" — Destiny's Child</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Destiny's Child</a> achieved its final form with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Beyoncé</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Kelly Rowland</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Michelle Williams</a>, the group went through a series of members.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Destiny's Child initially started with Beyoncé, Kelly, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>LaTavia Roberson</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Letoya Luckett</a>.

At the time, she was fresh off a break up with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Joe Jonas </a>and when host Ellen DeGeneres asked about their relationship, the singer was surprisingly candid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That guy is not in my life anymore, unfortunately," she said, pointing to a picture of her and the Jonas brother.
