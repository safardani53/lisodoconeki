The bombing killed four people — three 14-year-old girls and one 11-year-old girl — and injured more than 20 others. A funeral for three of the four girls was attended by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who delivered a speech during the proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>Despite the high-profile nature of the massacre, the FBI ended their investigation after two years and blocked any impending prosecutions. The case wasn't reopened until the 1970s, with the first conviction occurring in 1977. Robert Chambliss was sentenced to life in prison. Two of the remaining three bombers, Thomas Blanton and Bobby Cherry, weren't convicted until the early 2000s and the fourth suspected participant, Herman Cash, was never charged and died a free man.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alaska: Robert Hansen the Butcher Baker</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Alaska Dept of Corrections</span></figure><p><br></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>Robert Hansen was a serial killer who preyed on women in the Anchorage area throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. He killed at least 17 women and admitted to raping 30 others. His nickname comes from his profession as a baker.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>He mainly targeted sex workers because they were "harder to track and less likely to be missed," and would often abduct them and release them in the wilderness, only to hunt them down with a rifle as they fled. He was sentenced to 461 years and died in 2014 at age 75.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Arizona: Jodi Arias</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Arizona Department of Corrections</span></figure><p><br></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>Certainly there are killers with higher body counts in the Grand Canyon State, but their notoriety is eclipsed by that of Jodi Arias, who killed her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander in cold blood and tried to convince a jury that the grisly crime was in self defense despite the overkill and clear signs of premeditation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The case got a lot of media attention, likely due to the fact that Jodi was an attractive young woman, not the typical defendant one pictures with such brutal crimes, and for the graphic details about her sex life that unfolded during the trial.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Arkansas: The West Memphis murders of Stephen Branch, Christopher Byers, and James Moore</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p><br></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>In 1994, three teens were convicted for murdering three young boys in West Memphis, AR, with the prosecution asserting that the killings were part of a Satanic ritual. The three defendants, Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelley, and Jason Baldwin say they were targeted because they were misfits who enjoyed heavy metal music.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>The trial and conviction of the "West Memphis Three" drew national attention, with celebrities like Johnny Depp and Eddie Vedder advocating for their exoneration. In 2010, the three were &nbsp;allowed to enter an Alford plea, which allowed them to assert their innocence while acknowledging there is sufficient evidence to convict them. A judge released them after serving 18 years in jail. The real killers have never been caught.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">California: The Golden State Killer (AKA the East Area Rapist / Original Night Stalker)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Los Angeles Police Department</span></figure><p><br></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>California has a lot of candidates to consider and honestly, we mulled it over for a long time, considering the unsolved Zodiac Killer case, the Manson Family murders, and even the most famous unsolved case of all time, the Black Dahlia murder. But the <a href=#>Golden State Killer</a> wins for the nature of his crimes and for how long he successfully evaded capture. It wasn't until DNA technology was advanced enough that California investigators discovered the same serial rapist who terrorized Northern California in the '70s had moved south and escalated to murder, taking the lives of at least 13.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>The GSK seemed motivated by inflicting terror on his victims. He would often target heterosexual couples, subduing and restraining the men while assaulting their wives or girlfriends. Survivors would often receive prank phone calls later so the attacker could reignite their terror and feed off it.&nbsp;</p><p>On April 25, 2018, police announced the arrest of Joseph James DeAngelo, whose DNA matched samples found at crime scenes.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Colorado: the murder of JonBenét Ramsay</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Wikimedia Commons/Getty Images</span></figure><p><br></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>Perhaps we'll never have answers as to what happened to this 6-year-old pageant princess — though plenty of people obsessed with the case are <a href=#>convinced they've solved it</a> — but the strange circumstances around the death of JonBenet have made it one of the most talked about child murders in history.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Connecticut: The Sandy Hook massacre</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p><br></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting will likely remain the most notorious crime in Connecticut history for all time. At least I hope nothing worse befalls the state. In 2012, 20-year-old Adam Lanza devastated the town of Newtown, CT, killing 27 in total. Lanza first murdered his mother before driving her car to the school. Some victims were children as young as 6. Lanza completed suicide as first responders arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Delaware: The Chocolate Candy Murders</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Cordelia Botkin is not only the most notorious killer in Delaware history but the first to commit murder by mail.

Then she sent a box of chocolates with the note, "With love to yourself and baby."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>Elizabeth shared the chocolates with her sister and some others on the porch of her father's home. Two days later, Elizabeth and her older sister, 44-year-old Ida Harriet Deane, died from arsenic poisoning. The four others who ate the poisoned candies lived. A handwriting comparison of the note that accompanied the candy to previous correspondence from Botkin linked her to the crime.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Florida: The murder of Caylee Marie Anthony</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Florida is another state with <a href=#>plenty of candidates</a> for most notorious crime. However, the high-profile trial and endless documentary specials and movies of the week pushed this technically unsolved crime to the top of the list. Though <a href=#>mother Casey Anthony</a> was acquitted of first-degree murder in the 2008 death of her daughter, 2-year-old Caylee, the public seems convinced the young mom, who didn't report her daughter missing for a month, is the responsible party.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Georgia: The Atlanta child murders</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fulton County Police Department</span></figure><p>A string of murders of young black boys terrorized Atlanta families from 1979 to 1981. The slayings have been attributed to Wayne Williams, an aspiring talent scout and record producer. However, Williams was never tried and convicted of any child murders, but rather in the deaths of two adult men. Investigators, including famed FBI profiler John Douglas, believe "the forensic and behavioral evidence points conclusively to Wayne Williams as the killer of 11 young men in Atlanta." Also, strong DNA evidence from hairs found on the body of 11-year-old Patrick Baltazar link to Williams and his family's dog.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hawaii: The Honolulu Strangler</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>The most notorious crime of the Aloha state is an unsolved string of serial murders of women whose bodies were found in lagoons around Honolulu and neighboring Waipahu from 1985 to 1986.

Seven weeks later, Shasta turned up alive at a Coeur d'Alene Denny's. Her brother, unfortunately, was found murdered days later. Shasta's testimony was instrumental in putting together what had happened to her family and ensuring Duncan's conviction. The killer later admitted to three other murders in California and Washington, though he has not been convicted of two of the three.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Illinois: John Wayne Gacy</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Illinois is yet another state with plenty of good candidates for the "most notorious crime" superlative. However, you truly don't get much eviler or more sensational than Killer Clown John Wayne Gacy. He killed at least 33 young boys and men ranging in age from 15 to 21 and buried their bodies in the basement and crawl space of his home. At his execution he simply had three words for spectators: "Kiss my ass."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Indiana: Belle Gunness</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Wikimedia Commons</span></figure><p>Born Brynhild Paulsdatter Størseth, Belle Gunness was a black widow who would post ads wooing men from Indiana and Illinois, whom she would murder by poisoning, bludgeoning and in a few cases arson, collecting on the insurance money or on whatever cash assets she had convinced them to bring along from their hometowns. Then, when the heat turned up, she killed her three children and staged her death by decapitating an unidentified female victim. She enlisted her hired hand, Ray Lamphere, with setting fire to the farm to obscure the identity of her remains. She killed anywhere from 25 to 40 victims and was never caught.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Iowa: The Villisca Axe Murders</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Wikimedia Commons</span></figure><p>In 1912, eight people were murdered in the night, bludgeoned to death in their beds with the blunt end of an axe. The murder weapon was found beside a 4-pound slab of bacon. Reverend Lyn George Jacklin Kelly fell under suspicion for the brutal murders when he boarded a train west the morning after the murders and allegedly announced to his fellow travelers that an entire family back home was butchered in their beds — only at that point the bodies had not yet been discovered. Kelly confessed but recanted the confession at his trial. He was acquitted, and no one else was tried afterward.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kansas: Dennis Rader, AKA the BTK Killer</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Kansas Dept of Corrections</span></figure><p>We've got a <a href=#>whole article on this guy</a>, and even though he doesn't have a ton of competition, he's definitely earned his spot at the top of the most notorious killers in Kansas. He bound, tortured, and killed 10 people in the '70s and '80s. He would've gotten away with it, too, had he not continued to taunt police, who traced one of his packages to the church where he worked.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kentucky: The Standard Gravure shooting</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>In 1989, Joseph Thomas Wesbecker went to his former workplace, a printing factory called Standard Gravure, with an AK-47, two handguns, a bayonet, and hundreds of ammunition rounds. It's believed he received a letter from the company shortly before the massacre, which announced his disability payments would soon be suspended. He killed eight employees and injured 12 others before taking his own life. The tragedy remains the deadliest mass shooting in the history of Kentucky.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Louisiana: The Axeman of New Orleans</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Wikimedia Commons</span><p>1919 sheet music to a Joseph John Davilla composition about the serial killer</p></figure><p>Though it's been nearly 100 years since he struck, the Axeman of New Orleans is still the most notorious killer from the Pelican State. He killed six and injured six more over a period of 18 months from May 1918 to October 1919. The Axeman's story owes its staying power to a letter someone claiming to be the perpetrator sent to newspapers on March 13, 2019, saying he would kill again at 15 minutes past midnight on the night of March 19, but households who played jazz music at that time would live to see another day:&nbsp;</p><p>"I am very fond of jazz music, and I swear by all the devils in the nether regions that every person shall be spared in whose home a jazz band is in full swing at the time I have just mentioned. If everyone has a jazz band going, well, then, so much the better for you people. One thing is certain and that is that some of your people who do not jazz it out on that specific Tuesday night (if there be any) will get the axe."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Maine: The North Pond Hermit</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Kennebec Co. Sheriff file</span></figure><p>Maine has its share of murderers, but perhaps the most intriguing criminal in the state's history is Christopher Knight, who evaded police for 27 years as he committed more than 1,000 burglaries of homes in the North Pond area. Knight left home at 20 without notice and spent the next few decades living off food found in houses and vacation cabins in the area and stealing propane and other supplies to help him survive in the wild. He lived in the wilderness that entire time, even in the coldest months of the year, which is incredible if you've ever been to Maine in the winter. A game warden eventually captured the elusive hermit in April 2013. Knight was sentenced to 7 months in jail, the majority of which he served while awaiting sentencing, plus $2,000 in restitution, counseling, and three years of probation.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Maryland: the Murder of Hae Min Lee</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>Baltimore holds the dubious record of having the most murders per capita of any city in the U.S., so it can be hard to choose one crime in the state of Maryland out of such a big pool. However, the hit podcast Serial made <a href=#>Adnan Syed</a> a household name. Convicted in 1999 for the murder of his ex girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, Syed had listeners obsessed with the case and debating his guilt. Since the series aired, a lower court granted Syed a new trial, a decision that has been tied up in appeals court since.

He was tried and convicted for racketeering in 2013 and was imprisoned first in Florida, then in Oklahoma, and finally in West Virginia. Shortly after his transfer to FCI Hazelton, the 89-year-old gangster was found beaten to death, his eyes gouged out, and his tongue nearly severed completely in a clear mob hit fueled by Bulger's longtime role as an informant.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Michigan: The disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division.

He had been involved in organized crime for many years and is presumed dead. Speculation as to what happened has kept him alive in true crime fans' memory all these years, with the prevailing theory for many years holding that he was buried underneath Giants Stadium in New Jersey, though when no human remains were found when the football venue was demolished in 2010.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Minnesota: The murder of Jacob Wetterling</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Steve Warren, Wikimedia Commons</span></figure><p>This abduction of 11-year-old Jacob was a mystery for nearly 30 years, until his killer, Danny James Heinrich, led authorities to where he left him as part of a plea bargain. He is also responsible for abducting and sexually assaulting at least one other boy, Jared Scheierl. As part of the agreement, Heinrich wasn't tried for Jacob's murder, and the statute of limitations for his assault on Jared had expired. He was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for possession of child pornography, but the judge made it clear the trial was really about Jacob.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mississippi: The murder of Emmett Till</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>(L) a photo on the plaque marking Till's grave in Aslip, Illinois; (R) a photo of Till's mangled body as part of an exhibit at the Chicago Historical Society.</p></figure><p>Emmett Till was 14 years old when he was accused of wolf-whistling at an adult white woman who worked as a grocery clerk.

Accounts of what the young boy did or said are unclear, as Bryant's account changed each time she gave it.

A medical examination determined he died from a massive skull fracture, which possibly &nbsp;occurred when the boy was dropped as he was carried down a ladder from his second-floor bedroom.

Upon capture, Berkowitz told police his neighbor's dog, Sam, was possessed by a demon and he was Sam's servant. However, this appears to have been a plot to get an insanity plea, and Berkowitz later recanted that part of his story, admitting his killings were driven by a desire to get revenge on a world he felt had rejected him.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">North Carolina: The Lawson Family Christmas Day massacre</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Wikimedia Commons</span></figure><p>On Christmas in 1929, tobacco farmer Charlie Lawson murdered his wife and six of his seven children. The only survivor was his eldest son, 16-year-old Arthur, whom he had sent on an errand just before committing the crime. Lawson then went into the woods and shot himself. Not long after the family was annihilated, Lawson's brother Marion turned the murder house into a tourist attraction. A raisin cake Lawson's wife Marie had baked for Christmas dinner was displayed on the tour and visitors would take raisins as souvenirs until the cake was eventually protected with glass. No explanation ever surfaced for the sudden familicide. Sole survivor Arthur died in a car accident 16 years later at age 32.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">North Dakota: The Wolf family murders</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Grand Forks Herald</span></figure><p>Yet another family annihilation with one survivor.

As for why he left the baby alive: "The reason I did not kill the baby was, I believe, because I did not go into the room in which the baby lay," he said.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ohio: Ariel Castro kidnappings</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Castro's home.</p></figure><p>Ariel Castro kidnapped three women between 2002 and 2004 — Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Gina DeJesus — keeping them in his Cleveland home until May 6, 2013, when Michelle and her 6-year-old daughter escaped and went to the police.

McKinney's lawyer later tried to mount a defense that "gay panic" caused his client to lash out at Matthew, but the judge rejected this defense.
