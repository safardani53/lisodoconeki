Randy <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>co-founded The Eagles</a> with the late <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Glenn Frey</strong></a>, <strong>Don Henley</strong>, and <strong>Bernie Leadon</strong>. He is credited for working on various albums with the group, including: <i>Eagles, Desperado, On The Border, One of These Nights,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Hotel California</i>. Amid <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his passing</a>, below is everything to know about Randy’s two <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>previous marriages</a>.</p><h2>Randy Meisner’s First Wife</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>The “Take It to the Limit” hitmaker first got married in 1963 to a woman named&nbsp;<strong>Jennifer Barton</strong>. Randy’s first marriage came before his massive success with The Eagles and lasted nearly 20 years. The late bassist <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ended his marriage</a> with Jennifer in 1981, just four years after he left the band. Notably, when Randy married his first wife, he was still in his teens, as he was around 17 years old, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NPR</a>.</p><h2>Randy Meisner’s Second Wife, Lana Meisner</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Nearly 20 years later in 1996, Randy found love once more. That year, he married his late wife,&nbsp;<strong>Lana Rae</strong>, who he dated for many years prior. The two had a long relationship that was sadly cut short after Lana’s sudden death in Mar. 2016, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. The late brunette beauty accidentally fatally shot herself at the couple’s home in Los Angeles, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS News</a>. Her death took place seven years prior to Randy’s.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Soon after Lana’s sudden passing, Randy asked a judge for the “temporary conservatorship for himself,” according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS News</a>. At the time, Randy noted that he was “barely able to accept the sudden and tragic loss of his loving wife.” The outlet also revealed that the pair had a “tumultuous marriage.” Additionally, court docs obtained by the outlet claimed that the late musician suffered from “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bipolar disorder</a>, traumatic brain injury and substance abuse.” Randy’s lawyer at the time,&nbsp;<strong>Bruce Fuller</strong>, noted that Lana and her late spouse “loved each other very, very deeply.”</p><h2>Randy Meisner’s Kids</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Randy-Meisners-Wife-everett-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Randy welcomed all <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three of his kids</a> with his first wife, Jennifer. Their first son, <strong>Dana Scott Meisner</strong>, was born in Nov 1963, while their twins, <strong>Heather Leigh</strong> and <strong>Eric Shane Meisner</strong>, were born in May 1970. It is unclear if Randy’s kids maintained a relationship with their father as adults and in the years leading up to his death. However, the 2016 CBS News article noted that at the time, he was estranged from his kids.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The same outlet reported that “all three” of his kids “filed petitions in support of the 2015 temporary conservatorship.” Eric reportedly claimed that his relationship with his dad shifted after Randy split from Jennifer. “Lana has been isolating my father from his family for over 30 years,” Eric allegedly wrote at the time, per CBS News. “My father has repeatedly stated his love for his family and his desire to be with us, but Lana continually interferes with his relationship with us.” It is unclear what their relationship was at the time of his death in 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9GapZ2xXaKyqr%2FNnqlmr5mbsm6BkG1pcmhpZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frandy-meisner-wife-5142909.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frandy-meisner-wife-5142909.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frandy-meisner-wife-5142909.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frandy-meisner-wife-5142909.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frandy-meisner-wife-5142909.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frandy-meisner-wife-5142909.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./audrey-dunhams-husband-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./audrey-dunhams-husband-list.html>Audrey Dunhams Husband: Who is Audrey Dunham Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./say-yes-to-the-dress-memorable-brides-200k-budget-to-completely-sheer-dress.html>Say Yes To The Dress memorable brides $200k budget to completely sheer dress Thu 15 Dece</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./say-yes-to-the-dress-memorable-brides-200k-budget-to-completely-sheer-dress.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
