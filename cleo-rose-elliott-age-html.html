Her previous husbands were&nbsp;Joel Fabiani, John Marion, Conrad L. Hall, and Gaetano Lisi. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Previously, both of them had also worked on the movie titled Butch Cassidy. However, they didn't speak back then as Elliott was just a supporting actor who couldn't muster enough courage to talk to Katharine, a lead actress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In 1985, the proud parents welcomed Cleo to the world.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Why did Cleo Allegedly Stabbed Her Mother Katharine?</h2><p>Cleo was in the limelight from the day she was born. She is the&nbsp;daughter&nbsp;of Academy Award-nominated actor Sam Elliott and his actress spouse, Katharine Ross.</p><p>However, despite being the only daughter of the renowned couple, Cleo's relationship with her mother was not very healthy.&nbsp;Katharine even got a restraining order out against her daughter Cleo.</p><p>Writing&nbsp;in the restraining order in March 2011,&nbsp;Katharine revealed&nbsp;that her daughter&nbsp;Cleo was abusive as a child, and&nbsp;when she reached the age of 12 or 13, she became violent. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"[Cleo] verbally and emotionally abused me even as a little girl but became increasingly violent at age 12 or 13," The Graduate actress stated. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The sourness in their relationship came out in public&nbsp;after&nbsp;Cleo&nbsp;reportedly <a href=# rel="follow noopener">stabbed Katharine with scissors</a> and&nbsp;Katharine obtained&nbsp;a restraining order against her daughter.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>According to the 83-year-old actress, her daughter&nbsp;lost her temper out of the blue and began murmuring, “I want to kill you.” Afterward, she kicked the cupboard door, and&nbsp;when Katharine tried to reach out to the police, Cleo cut off the telephone wire with scissors.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Cleo&nbsp;then&nbsp;threatened to hit her in the eye with the scissors but later&nbsp;stabbed her six times in the right arm.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>"[Cleo&nbsp;stabbed]&nbsp;using enough force to pierce my skin through my shirt and leave me with marks that are still visible today,"&nbsp;Katharine revealed in her statement.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Not only that, Katharine stated that her daughter cut the phone line with scissors when she tried to inform the police before stabbing her in the arms,&nbsp;"using enough force to pierce my skin through my shirt and leave me with marks that are still visible today."</p><p>After that incident, Katharine filed&nbsp;for a protective order, and the court issued a hearing on 30 March 2011. Until the hearing took place, Cleo was ordered to stay at least 100 yards away from her mother’s home, workplace, and car. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Nevertheless, to date, it is still unclear what prompted Cleo to stab her own mother.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><h2>Cleo’s Relationship with Her Mother Seems to Be Improving</h2><p>Although Cleo, 37, and her mother had an unforgettable moment, it now seems that they have put aside all the bad blood between them.</p><p>The mother-daughter can be seen together at various events, and award&nbsp;shows, which hints that their relationship is improving.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They were spotted&nbsp;together at the 2017 Sundance Flim Festival’s red carpet event for the movie The Hero, which featured Cleo’s parents. During the event, an interviewer asked her about her parents.</p><p>In reply, Cleo stated that&nbsp;her parents were very talented actors, which made her proud.</p><p>On 24 September 2018, Cleo and her mother, Katharine, were again seen&nbsp;together at the premiere of A Star is Born. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They were also together&nbsp;at the 91st <a href=# rel=follow>Annual Academy Awards</a>, where both of them were smiling and seemed very happy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Is Cleo Rose Eliott Married to a Husband or Dating?</h2><p>Cleo hasn't been married yet, but she was engaged to a man with a similar interest in music in <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Randy Christopher Bates</a>, a recording artist, songwriter, composer, and cycle & motorbike enthusiast.&nbsp;</p><p>However, their relationship ended by April 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Currently, Cleo has been dating a musician named Jacob, who seems to be a member of the band,&nbsp;B&TB (Beauty & The Beast)&nbsp;she has been involved with.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><h2>How old is Cleo Rose Elliott?</h2><p>Born on 17 September&nbsp;1984 (age 38&nbsp;years) in Malibu California,&nbsp; Cleo was an early <a href=# rel="follow noopener">learner of flue and guitar</a>. She also developed singing skills at an early age in her childhood and it was her primary interest.</p><p>From 2002 to 2006, she studied music at the&nbsp;Joanne Baron/D.W. Brown Acting Studio&nbsp;in Santa Monica, California.</p><p>She also undertook classical vocal training, specializing in Talian opera and Bel Cano's musical tradition,&nbsp;from Charity Champman, a famous musical artist and prolific songwriter after her graduation from Colin McEwan High School.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2003, she was featured&nbsp;in the live hair-styling show titled S*xyhair as a model. Later, she would also get featured in many popular fashion magazines.</p><p>In such an early stage of her career, she also got exposure from the events she attended with her famous parents such as the 2013's Emmy Awards. She ended up meeting more famous musicians and got training from many of them.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Eventually, she signed up with the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers after music producer Bobby Harby introduced her to the institution.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Harby was impressed by her vocal range and her songwriting skills. After she showcased to him her first self-written song, he was instrumental to have her studio record it.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In 2008, Cleo, who admired Guns N' Roses, Led Zeppelin to the Verdi repertoire, finally released her first solo CD album, No More Lies, which showcased her rock musical influences much more than her Italian opera skills.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>“The sound is very pop rock, but I’m really into heavy hard rock,” she said speaking to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">The Malibu Times </a>prior to the release of the album.</p><p>She also touched on how she used her Italian opera musical background to her use, stating, “Classical opera is the best way to warm up your voice for singing rock. You don’t want to lose your voice rocking out."&nbsp;</p><p>Later in the interview, she gushed about her supportive parents and her upcoming plans. She shared,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>I’m working on selling this one and working on some more songs. My parents are totally supportive of this. They’re just happy I don’t want to be an actor.</p><p>But since the album, the songstress hasn't released any official music yet, possibly because her controversy with her mom (the stabbing incident) slowed down her career.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>But now, she is back with a new band called Beauty and The Beast, as per her Instagram.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><h2>What is Cleo Rose Elliot's Net Worth?</h2><p>Cleo's estimated net worth is speculated to be $1.5 million dollar, a figure she could have achieved&nbsp;primarily through the contributions of her rich parents.&nbsp;</p><p>According to<a href=# rel="follow noopener"> Celebritynetworth</a>, her mother Katharine Ross, and her father Sam Elliot&nbsp;has a combined estimated net worth of $20 million.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5i5pruMq6asnV2aua21zq2rZpmXmnupwMyl</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcleo-rose-elliott-age-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcleo-rose-elliott-age-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcleo-rose-elliott-age-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcleo-rose-elliott-age-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcleo-rose-elliott-age-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcleo-rose-elliott-age-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./melissa-spalding-paul-hollywood-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./melissa-spalding-paul-hollywood-wife.html>Meet Melissa Spalding, Paul Hollywoods Soon-To-Be Wife</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./justin-peters.html>Justin Peters</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./justin-peters.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
