The Stone Age was great because the clothes were easy to draw. The Georgian was fun because the clothes were so bizarre.”</p><p>If you want to improve your own drawing style, Martin suggests: “Draw as often as possible, learn as many different techniques as you can and teach yourself how to draw the tricky things, such as drawing horses or cars.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“But most of all, have fun and don’t worry if it doesn’t look ‘right’.”<br>Terry has the following advice for wannabe writers: “Write the last sentence first, that way it’s like having a map to guide you</p><p>“Apparently J.K.
