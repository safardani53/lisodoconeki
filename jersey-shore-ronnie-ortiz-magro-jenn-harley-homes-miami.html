They'll be relocating after their homes are sold."</p><p>Ronnie had previously <a href=#>filed a lawsuit</a> against Jenn, 35, in November 2021 attempting to force her to sell the home they once shared together so he can make some profit, as he claimed she hasn't been making loan payments.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="read more US Sun exclusives">read more US Sun exclusives</h2><p>Her attorney slammed Ronnie, telling <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>: "Ronnie and Jenn agreed it's her house and she paid Ronnie for it, plus she pays the mortgage and invested six figures into improvements.</p><p>"Jenn tried to finalize financing on the house to get Ronnie off the mortgage, but he refused, and now Ron 'wants a windfall that he is not entitled to.'"</p><p>The lawsuit has since been settled.</p><h2><strong>BACK TO BEING SINGLE</strong></h2><p>The source told The U.S Sun: "Ronnie and Jenn decided to both move to Miami to start over, especially now that they're both single.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"They'll be living separately and will still share custody of Ariana."</p><p>The TV star and his ex share their four-year-old daughter, Ariana Sky Magro.</p><p>Ronnie and his ex-fiancée, Saffire Matos, <a href=#>ended their engagement</a> this past summer.</p><p>She is now dating influencer and a former prisoner-turned motivational speaker Cody Padrino, 36.</p><p>The U.S. Sun reported in November that Ronnie "has been trying to <a href=#>win her back</a>."</p><p>Jenn, for her part, has been dating chef Joe Ambrosole since the end of 2020. They broke things off a couple of months ago.</p><h2><strong>CUSTODY BATTLE</strong></h2><p>Back in October, The U.S. Sun <a href=#>exclusively reported</a> that Ronnie won physical custody of his only daughter after a judge ruled in his favor.&nbsp;They both have joint legal custody.</p><p>The judge wrote in court docs: "Ariana's primary residence is with&nbsp;the father in California. This order is made with the knowledge that Ariana will be starting school soon and needs a primary residence with one parent. Ariana will be with father at all times."</p><p>Jenn was granted visitation in her home state of Nevada. She has custody on the weekends from Fridays to Sundays.</p><p>An insider told The U.S. Sun: "They are getting along better and coparenting amicably now."</p><h2><strong>INSIDE THEIR CRIBS</strong></h2><p>Ronnie purchased <a href=#>his Los Angeles home</a> - featured on <a href=#>Jersey Shore</a> - in August 2020 for $1.9million and put it up for sale on October 19, 2022. It initially was $3million but has been cut to $2.9million.</p><p>The 5,800 square foot "ultra-luxurious" home has five beds and six baths.</p><p>It comes "fully-furnished" and features an open concept kitchen with "premium stainless-steel appliances," a massive walk-in closet in the master bedroom, an "outdoor poolside oasis" and a large gym where Ronnie has posted videos of himself working out.</p><p>Jenn's home went up for sale on January 6, 2023 and is listed for nearly $1.5million. The four bedroom, four bathroom, 2,955 square foot home is being sold by Jenn Harley, herself, of Realty ONE Group.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/jenn-harleys-house-jersey-shore-786913364.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/jenn-harleys-house-jersey-shore-786913146.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/jenn-harleys-house-jersey-shore-786913304.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/jenn-harleys-house-jersey-shore-786913357.jpg><p>The modern home is located in a gated community and features full panoramic views of the famous Vegas strip. It includes marble flooring, two fireplaces, an outdoor balcony, a large outdoor patio with a sunken fire pit and a "stunning" pool and spa with a sun deck.</p><h2><strong>NEW CHAPTER</strong></h2><p>Despite the Las Vegas realtor and former TV personality's past history of <a href=#>multiple domestic violence arrests</a>&nbsp;and rehab attempts, they both have stayed out of trouble these past two years.</p><p>In April 2021, Ronnie was arrested for domestic violence for an incident involving Saffire. He had violated his previous probation against Jenn, and after a September 2021 hearing, the judge placed a three-year protective order on Saffire and ordered Ronnie to take parenting classes.</p><p>Jenn was arrested for <a href=#>domestic violence</a> in June 2021&nbsp;after she threatened her boyfriend Joe at the time with a deadly weapon.&nbsp;The charges were dismissed a few months later.</p><p>Ron has been on the down low since&nbsp;<a href=#>stepping away</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href=#>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</a>&nbsp;in the spring of 2021.</p><p>Ronnie's statement read: "After talking to the team at&nbsp;MTV, we have mutually agreed that I will step away from the show while I seek medical treatment for mental health issues that I've ignored too long.</p><p>"My number one goal now is facing my struggles head on."</p><p>Ronnie concluded: "This process will be difficult, but my <a href=#>#1 priority is to get healthy</a> and be the best man and the best father I can for my daughter."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>However, he is still showing support for the show that made him famous.</p><p>In a recent Instagram post, he captioned a pic with Mike <a href=#>"The Situation"</a> Sorrentino, <a href=#>Pauly D</a> and <a href=#>Vinny Guadagnino</a>: "Time to get the band back together -
