Unlike his running mate, former president <a href=#>Donald Trump</a>, Mike has remained out of the spotlight and quietly embarked on a book tour.</p><p>Now, Mike Pence has resurfaced once more, but not in a good way. What is Mike Pence doing now? Here's everything you need to know about his book tour and the recent discovery of classified documents inside his home.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Mike Pence doing now?</h2><p>In December 2022, Mike Pence launched a book tour for his autobiography, So Help Me God, published by Simon & Schuster on Nov. 15, 2022. According to the book's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official summary</a>, it follows "the chronicle of the events and people who forged Mike Pence’s character," including "President Trump’s severing of their relationship on Jan. 6, 2021, when Pence kept his oath to the Constitution."</p><p>The tour kicked off on Nov. 22, 2022, at the Eugene and Marilyn Glick Indiana History Center in Indiana, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo! Entertainment</a>. As of Jan. 7, 2023, he was still on tour, but there may be a halt in those plans after a new investigation revealed classified documents were found at his Indiana residence.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The FBI is investigating classified documents discovered at Mike Pence's home.</h2><p>According to <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, one of Mike Pence's lawyers discovered "about a dozen documents marked as classified" in Pence's home, which were immediately turned over to the FBI. The outlet notes that the FBI and the Justice Department’s National Security Division have begun a review of the documents and the circumstances of their arrival in Pence's home.</p><p>As it turns out, Pence had asked his lawyer, Matt Morgan, to conduct a search of his home "out of an abundance of caution." Morgan reportedly went through four boxes and found "a small number of documents with classified markings," to which he alerted the National Archives, which alerted the Justice Department.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>A letter written by Pence’s representative to the Archives, Greg Jacob, read, "Vice President Pence was unaware of the existence of sensitive or classified documents at his personal residence. Vice President Pence understands the high importance of protecting sensitive and classified information and stands ready and willing to cooperate fully with the National Archives and any appropriate inquiry."</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not the first instance of classified documents being discovered in personal residences in recent times. The FBI searched former president Donald Trump's residence <a href=#>for classified materials</a> in August 2022, and in January 2023, President Joe Biden's home was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">also searched for classified material</a>.</p><p>Hopefully in the near future, government officials will learn to stop bringing their work home with them. In the meantime, citizens will have to wait until the review of the documents has been completed to learn more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmalmaCybrzEp5qeZZSktq%2BzjKemsA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-mike-pence-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-mike-pence-doing-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-mike-pence-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-mike-pence-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-mike-pence-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-mike-pence-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-faze-rain-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-faze-rain-dating.html>Who is FaZe Rain Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sapphire-sandalo-19880921-html.html>Sapphire Sandalo (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sapphire-sandalo-19880921-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
