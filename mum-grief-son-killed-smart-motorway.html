Eight years we raised a child, through the sleepless nights, through the colds and the coughs.</p><p>"To lose that overnight is just heart-breaking.</p><p>"Dev was very academic, he was captain of the football team, the rugby team, the cricket team. He excelled at school and he wanted to be a brain surgeon to help his brother.</p><h2>MUM'S HEARTACHE</h2><p>"We raised him to be Neel’s guardian in the future if anything was to happen to us. We taught him all the life skills to be a really good person.It was an immense shock."</p><p>Neel, who has had brain damage since birth, recovered but stopped talking and walking when he discovered his younger brother had died.</p><p>It comes after it was revealed<a href=#> 38 people have been killed on smart motorways in the past five years</a>.</p><p>The grim toll is blamed on the removal of hard shoulders, leaving drivers nowhere safe to stop when they break down.</p><p>Near-misses on one stretch of the reconfigured M25 outside London rose 20-fold to 1,485 in the five years since the hard shoulder was taken away.</p><p>I don’t want another family to see their child’s dead body in front of them</p><span class=quote-credit>Meera Naran</span><p>The figures come from an investigation into the 200 miles of smart motorways by BBC’s Panorama, as the government urgently probes their safety.</p><p>It also found that one warning sign on the the M25 had been out of action for 336 days.</p><p>Smart motorways are <a href=#>sections of main roads that are monitored by technology to manage the flow of traffic in busy times.</a></p><p>Operators can vary the speed limit - with lit signs on overhead gantries - with the aim of reducing the frustrating stop-start driving conditions that often occur on normal roads.</p><p>Smart motorways can also increase capacity of the road by opening up the hard shoulder at busy times.</p><h2>DRIVERS IN DANGER</h2><p>Safety experts and MPs are calling for the controversial roads to be scrapped as drivers are being left stranded in dangerous situations on the side of the road.</p><p>Recent figures have revealed more than 19,000 motorists have broken down in a live lane over the past two years, a rate of 26 drivers a day.</p><p>The former minister who approved the idea said he was misled about the risks.
