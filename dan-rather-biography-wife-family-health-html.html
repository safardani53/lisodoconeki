Rathers currently works on a weekly newscast called The News With Dan Rathers on a YouTube program The Young Turks.</span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p><strong>The News With Dan Rathers</strong>: Listen to Dan Rathers talk about American president Donald Trump, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and their historic meeting (published on 11 June 2018) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span>It's evident that his followers are well knowledged&nbsp;about his professional life, but they are deprived of information on his personal life as he seldom sheds light on it. However, we have succeeded&nbsp;to garner some information about his personal life, so if you are willing to know, keep reading it till the end!</span></p><h3><strong>Dan Rather's Biography</strong></h3><p>Dan Rather was born in a&nbsp;middle-class&nbsp;family, to parents Byrl Veda&nbsp;and Daniel Irvin Rather on 31st October&nbsp;1931 in&nbsp;Wharton, Texas.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>His&nbsp;family relocated&nbsp;to&nbsp;Houston when he was still a child. Dan commenced his education at Hamilton Middle School and later graduated&nbsp;with a degree in journalism from&nbsp;Sam Houston State University in Huntsville in 1953.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3><strong>Dan Rather's Career: Early Prodigy to Veteran Journalist</strong></h3><p>Dan landed himself in the realm of broadcasting when he was still a student. As his first broadcasting job, he worked at a small local radio station; then after,&nbsp;at KTRH-Radio in Houston.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 1960, Dan became director of news and public affairs at KHOU-TV, CBSâ€™s Houston&nbsp;affiliate. When, in the following year, his live coverage of Hurricane Carla caught the attention of network executives, they offered him a job as a CBS correspondent. He began working for CBS in March 1962.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But Dan's breakthrough came in 1975 after he joined&nbsp;60 Minutes,&nbsp;where&nbsp;he served as a&nbsp;correspondent for that program until 1981. Besides that, Dan even&nbsp;anchored and reported for the show&nbsp;48 Hours,&nbsp;which is also a popular show broadcasted by&nbsp;CBS. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Dan worked for CBS for over 40 years and was famous for presenting the news on&nbsp;CBS Evening News.&nbsp;However, his reporting on&nbsp;Killian documents controversy&nbsp;through CBS Evening News got a lot of criticism.</p><p>The documents involved six purported documents critical of President George W. Bush's Texas Air National Guard service. Among six papers, four of these documents were presented authentic by CBS.</p><p>The font applied to the documents has characteristics that exactly match the standard font features of Microsoft Word, which led to claims that the memos were forgeries and the accusations then spread over the following days into the mainstream media. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Dan and CBS defended the story&nbsp;saying that experts had authenticated the documents, but it later came to light that CBS had failed to validate the documents.</p><p>After that, CBS fired story producer Mary Mapes and asked three other producers connected with the story to resign. Some people believe that this incident hastened Rather's retirement from CBS.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><strong>Dan Rathers: Who Is He Married To?</strong></h2><p>Peeking towards Dan's personal life, he enjoys a happy&nbsp;married life with wife&nbsp;Jean Goebel. Dan first met Jean in 1956 when Dan was working as a news director for KTRH, where&nbsp;Jean was working as a secretary. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Without sparing more time in dating, Dan married Jean in 1957. The couple later welcomed their first child, the daughter&nbsp;named Robin&nbsp;in 1958, and a son named Danjack a couple of years later in 1960.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><img alt height=594 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/Dan%2BRather.jpg width=395 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Couple Alert: </strong>Dan Rather with his wife, Jean Goebel at an event<strong>&nbsp;</strong>(Photo:&nbsp;Zimbio.com)</p><p>As of now, the long-term&nbsp;married couple happily lives in Texas.
