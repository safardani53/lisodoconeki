<time>22 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>WHEN Shaun Nyland and Cat Keenan joined TikTok in November 2019, the couple could never have predicted how the app would turn their lives upside down.</p><p>In a new video on Cat's <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel</a>, the Newport-based couple - who share two kids - explained how they'd been together for about six years when they shot to internet fame.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000704535773.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000686808155.jpg><p>Within the first four months, Shaun managed to rack up over one MILLION followers while Cat quickly started matching her monthly dog-walking salary in a single day thanks to her hilarious clips.</p><p>But while this might sound like a total dream, the pair found that working together took a huge toll on their relationship.</p><p>Cat explained: "You would think that we would be getting closer - but in fact, we were getting more and more apart.</p><p>"It was almost like we'd become friends who just worked together."</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>FABULOUS BINGO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GET A £5 FREE BONUS WITH NO DEPOSIT REQUIRED</a></strong></p><p>Despite their best efforts to prioritise going on dates and spending more time together, Shaun and Cat broke up in March 2021 - but still stayed friends so they could co-parent Tommy and Leo.</p><p>However, Cat said she began to feel the struggle financially when Shaun moved out as she had the mortgage to pay off and pricey Range Rover payments to keep up with.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>She said: "I felt stressed about money because I had the house to pay for - we've got quite a big house with four bedrooms and it costs us a lot to pay each month.</p><p>"I had my Range Rover which we bought together but it was in my name so I took over that.</p><p>"That was costing me £1,000 a month alone on fuel."</p><p>"You had a lot of outgoings," Shaun said. "Don't get me wrong, I paid all my child maintenance but I knew deep down that it wasn't enough."</p><p>So for her 31st birthday in October last year, <a href=#>Shaun decided to surprise Cat by paying off the mortgage</a>.</p><p>I know we're not together anymore, and I've been so proud of you, you're the best mum ever, so I did something. I rang up the bank, I paid off the entire mortgage. This house now belongs to you.</p><span class=quote-credit>Shaun Nyland</span><p>In a clip on TikTok, which has racked up 4.3million views, Shaun is seen throwing Cat a set of keys, with her questioning, "why are you giving me these for?"</p><p>Shaun explains: "It's your birthday today, I want you to have the best birthday ever. And look, I know we're not together anymore, and I've been so proud of you, you're the best mum ever, so I did something. I rang up the bank, I paid off the entire mortgage. This house now belongs to you.</p><p>Naturally, Cat just assumed it was a prank at first - but Shaun had the bank email her to confirm that she was now mortgage-free.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">READ MORE REAL LIFE STORIES</h2></p><p>In a second clip, he explains: "At the end of the day, my ex-girlfriend gave me the best gift any man could ask for by bringing Leo into this world and I know it was tough for Cat to try and live the same lifestyle we lived but by herself."</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the kind gesture brought the couple much closer together and so they decided to start filming TikToks again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000704536155-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000704534915.jpg><p>She explained: "I caught feels again [...] to be honest, I was a bit confused. I was like, 'do I love him? Don't I?'"</p><p>But three months after Shaun's big gesture and the couple have decided to give their relationship another try.</p><p>Although Shaun thought they were filming a video telling their followers that they were going to take things slow, Cat used it as an opportunity to surprise him.</p><p>At the end of the clip, Cat turned to Shaun and asked him to be her boyfriend again - which resulted in him breaking down in tears.</p><p>She said: "We're in a really good place and my feelings are really strong towards you and I realised how much I love you.</p><p>"I just want to be with you again and as a family with the children and stuff and I want to make it really official now."</p><p>Shaun said: "You tricked me! Oh my god, I'm actually crying."</p><p>"Omg guys huge congratulations," one fan replied. "I’m so happy your back together you make such a great couple!</p><p>Another added: "You guys had me crying, congratulations! You are both amazing people."</p><p>For more relationship stories, this <a href=#>woman’s seemingly innocent snap of her hotel room goes viral after people spot something VERY rude</a> – but can you see it.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>And this <a href=#>woman found out her man was cheating when she saw a suspicious text on his phone</a> – then a friend sent her his dating profile.</p><p>Plus this <a href=#>woman's horror date was so bad she faked a positive Covid test to get out of it</a>… then slept with someone else the same night.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>I’m a dating expert – I encourage my clients to see multiple people at once by following one simple mantra</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BwaXFsZGt%2BcLnAp2SpmamoerCyxWacsWWdpL%2B1s8CgnGaqlai9sLrSnmStnZGnwHA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fman-pays-off-ex-mortgage-response-tears.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fman-pays-off-ex-mortgage-response-tears.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fman-pays-off-ex-mortgage-response-tears.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fman-pays-off-ex-mortgage-response-tears.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fman-pays-off-ex-mortgage-response-tears.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fman-pays-off-ex-mortgage-response-tears.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./marc-lukasiak-19750629-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./marc-lukasiak-19750629-html.html>Marc Lukasiak (Family Member) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./wwf-star-chyna-pics.html>WWE Star Chyna PICS Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./wwf-star-chyna-pics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
