<time>02 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>OK, so the short version is that free spins are spins offered on slot games that you don’t have to pay for. </strong>While that might seem quite straightforward, the details of each offer could make a big difference in its actual value to you.</p><p>And while that might be a correct definition to a certain extent, free spins are rarely just exactly what it says on the tin.</p><p>Free spin offers are immensely popular bonus offers at almost all UK online casinos. But, before you let the entertainment&nbsp;take over, remember that each offer always comes with its own set of terms you need to look out for. Based on these terms, you’ll be able to decide if the free spins offer is worth your time - if you're lucky, the prize will be easy to snatch and the payout will be generous.</p><p>In this article, I'll tell you exactly what to expect from free spins, the things to be wary of, and how to be sure you get the best deal possible.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best UK casinos with free spins bonuses</h2><li><strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">MrQ</a></strong></li><li><strong><a aria-label="Megaways (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Megaways</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=# aria-label="bet365 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">bet365</a></strong></li><li><strong><a aria-label="Duelz Casinobr / (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Duelz Casino</a></strong></li><li><strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">The Vic</a></strong></li><li><strong><a aria-label="Winomania (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Winomania</a></strong></li><li><strong><a aria-label="10bet (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">10bet</a></strong></li><li><strong><a aria-label="WinBritish (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">WinBritish</a></strong></li><li><strong><a aria-label="Amazon Slots (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Amazon Slots</a></strong></li><li><strong><a aria-label="Voodoobr / (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Voodoo Dreams</a></strong></li><li><strong><a aria-label="Mr Vegas (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Mr Vegas</a></strong></li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How I rated UK casinos with free spins bonuses</h2><p>When it comes to playing deposit casino games, activating free spins, or accepting a bonus or <a href=#>cashback offer</a>, there’s one rule you need to keep front and centre. A bonus is only as good as the online casino that’s offering it. There’s no sense in getting excited about 200 free spins if they’re offered by a dodgy online casino that will tie you up in unfair restrictions. You need to pay close attention to the ifs, whys, hows, and wheres, as these will help you to decide if the offer (and the spins casino) is right for you. Here are some of the most important factors to look out for:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Bonus size</strong> - Before you rush to punch in those bonus codes, find out exactly what you’ll be getting. Free spin offers are either capped or uncapped. An uncapped offer means that there’s no limit to how much you can win from your spins. But the majority of online casino bonuses come with limits. These limits cover how high you can set your bets, as well as the maximum amount you can win. Understanding these factors is key to determining the value of the bonus. If your win potential is capped too low, then it might not be worth your time and effort.</li><li><strong>Licensing and security </strong>- Where your casino is licensed is a very important factor to consider. The level of checks and balances in play, and the restrictions enforced upon the online casino will differ depending on where it’s licensed. The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) operates one of the safest licences in the business. The casino must have this licence in order to legally offer its services to UK-based players. If you’re located in the UK and playing on an online casino without a UKGC licence, you won’t be afforded any legal protection should things go wrong.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Payment methods</strong> - An online casino should offer users a varied selection of payment options. These must include all leading methods like VISA, Mastercard, Skrill, Neteller, and several others. Newer online casinos will even accept cryptocurrency. Another thing to note is that some free spin bonuses will exclude particular payment options.</li><li><strong>Slot variety</strong> - The games you’re permitted to play with your bonus can mean the difference between success and failure. Older slot machines tend to pay out in very low amounts, and if your bonus can only be used on lower-quality games then it’s probably not worth your time. Look out for bonuses that come on flashy, big-name games to really ramp up your chances of success.</li><li><strong>Safety measures</strong> - Your chosen online casino must be secure and set up to professionally protect your personal and financial information. Most online casinos will require you to make a deposit before you can trigger your free spins. But before revealing any sensitive information to the site, check the footer section for information about SSL encryption.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Customer support</strong> - It’s to be expected that things go wrong from time to time, and when that does happen you need to be sure there’s a team on hand to help. Check out the online casino’s customer support service. Ideally you should have access to live chat that’s available 24 hours a day.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Wagering requirements</strong> - Rollover requirements are a necessary evil of almost every bonus offer. The key is to make sure they’re fair and achievable. Ideally your <a href=# aria-label="wagering requirements (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">wagering requirements</a> are limited to 35x. Anything higher than this will make it really hard to turn bonus winnings into real, withdraw-able cash.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Time limits</strong> - Your bonus will always come with an expiry date. You need to complete wagering within the time specified or the bonus will be cancelled and you’ll lose out on any wins generated with the bonus cash. Ideally, 14 to 30 days are required to give you enough time. Withdrawal restrictions might apply to some offers, so be sure to read the fine print.</li></ul><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Mr Vegas sign up offer</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Mr-Vegas-Casino-Bonuses.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>100% up to £200 + 11 wager-free spins</p><p>18+ new players only.

These can be either static or changeable, depending on the season or theme. Free spins are a common way to reward players for making deposits. They can come tied to bonus cash, or they can stand alone. Regardless of where you’re playing, in the UK or anywhere else in the world, free spin offers always work the same way. Free spins can be awarded without any requirement, for example just by logging in or as a loyalty reward. However, it’s more common to trigger free spins in exchange for making a qualifying deposit or completing some other requirement built into the offer’s unique terms. Be sure to read through the dedicated promotional page, which will tell you everything you need to know.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A closer look at the top UK online casinos with free spins bonuses</h2><p>With so many online casinos making the rounds, and new ones popping up all time, it’s physically impossible to scan through the bonuses available at each one.

This online casino sounds like it’s made for UK players because it has. In fact, the site is the product of one of the most famous brick-and-mortar casinos in London - the Grosvenor. Relive the magic of pulling the slot machine lever as you navigate through their digital platform. Outstanding deposit bonuses await players who decide to sign up and play, and they will be treated to a three-level welcome offer that offers both bonus cash and free spins at every stage.

The only thing you need to watch out for are the wagering requirements. Only free spins that come <a href=# aria-label="wager-free (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">wager-free</a> will translate into instant cash prizes. Free spins with wagering requirements will generate bonus cash that has to be wagered a specific number of times before it can be withdrawn.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Can I claim free spins multiple times at UK online casinos?</h2><p>That depends entirely on the offer. For example, free spins that come attached to a <a href=#>welcome bonus</a> can only be claimed once. However, the promotions section at an online casino will usually always contain at least one free spins bonus. Some offers can be claimed more than once, while others are a one-time deal. The good news is that, at quality online casinos, a brand new free spins offer is always just around the corner, making it possible to include bonus spins with almost every deposit required.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="Register at The Vic and claim free spins and other rewards (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Register at The Vic and claim free spins and other rewards</a>.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to claim free spins bonuses:</h2><p>Ready to start cashing in on free spins? It’s very easy to claim and play. Like pulling the lever on a classic slot machine, all you need to do is match the right symbols. Here’s how:</p><li><strong>Choose your online casino</strong> (I make some great recommendations in this article, if I do say so myself)</li><li><strong>Visit the ‘offers’ or ‘promotions’ section</strong> on the site after you register and/or log in</li><li><strong>Scroll through the available promos</strong> until you find a super free spin bonus&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Read the terms and conditions</strong> to make sure it represents great value</li><li><strong>Follow the on-page instructions</strong> to activate the offer and get spinning</li><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Duelz Casino sign up offer</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thesun-claim-your-duelz-bonus.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>£100 bonus + 100 free spins on Book of Dead</p><p>18+ new players only.

They can be given out automatically, or triggered when players meet certain requirements - like making a deposit. Your spins give you the opportunity to play for real money without impacting your account balance. This factor is what makes them so popular.</p><ul><li>You get to play exciting slots for free with bonus cash</li><li>You’ll discover new slot games</li><li>Get a head start at new online casinos</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Disadvantages of free spins offers</h2><p>At the end of the day, unless you’re dealing with wager-free spins, you’re always going to have to contend with a range of restrictions. The major biggest one is the fact that you need to meet playthrough requirements that might result in no win at all. You should also consider that each free spin is capped, so your win potential can’t be cranked up to the max.</p><ul><li>Wagering requirements and other restrictions</li><li>You don’t always get to choose the game</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Mr-Vegas-Casino-Bonuses.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Which games can I use my free spins on?</h2><p>That depends on the terms of the free spin bonus. Of course, the choice of games is always slots - bonus credit in free spins wouldn't make much sense for table games like roulette, blackjack, <a href=# aria-label="poker (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">poker</a>, craps, or baccarat - but they’ll almost never be jackpot slots. Sometimes the online casino leaves this up to the player, restricting only a couple of games from the list, and you might even get "free spins" on a game such as the Wheel of Fortune. Other times, the site only lets players choose from a small selection of slots, or sometimes just one. The games available are always stated on the promotion page, so you can check out what’s on offer and decide if it’s right for you before going ahead.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="Use free spins at Duelz Casino on Book of Dead slots (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Use free spins at Duelz Casino on Book of Dead slots</a>.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Do free spins offers have wagering requirements in the UK?</h2><p>Yes. Most of the time free spins come with wagering requirements - but there are exceptions. Some <a href=# aria-label="UK online casinos (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">UK online casinos</a> offer players wager-free spins when making their first deposit, or when they hit a certain number of deposits with the site. But most of the time players can pick up free spin bonuses on-demand, and these almost always come with wagering requirements attached. The wagering requirements (sometimes called playthrough or rollover requirements) will vary from site to site. As a general rule, anything set below 35 x is considered to be fair and achievable.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Which UK casino has the best and biggest free spins bonus?</h2><p>MrQ Casino is one of my favourite online casinos right now. Players can pick up free spin offers in multiple formats, several times a week. You can start things off with the welcome offer, which hands out 35 spins in total on Book of Dead, five of those without even having to make a deposit at the casino.</p><p>The best part is, these spins come without any wagering requirements! That means anything you win will be instantly added to your account balance as real cash. Once you’ve exhausted the welcome offer, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">MrQ’s fully-stocked promotions section</a> will keep you entertained with plenty of fresh offers. You can even pick up more wager-free spins when you refer friends to come and join the fun.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">MrQ No deposit bonus</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Casino-Bonuses-MrQ-OP.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Get No Deposit Spins + 30 Free Spins on Your First Deposit with code THESUN35</p><p>18+ | First 5 spins: Players who have successfully completed age verification will be credited 5 Free Spins on Starburst 10p per spin, no deposit required, no wagering requirements.

That’s why you’ll find a whole range of options, from 10 wager-free spins, to 500 free spins with wagering requirements attached. What’s more, free spins are offered multiple times across your entire relationship with the online casino, so you can always go back for more should the mood take you. Remember, free spins are always optional, and you can choose to bypass them in favour of playing only with the funds you deposit to the site.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Do free spins offers have time limits?</h2><p>Yes. More often than not, free spins will expire if you don’t use them in time. Be sure to read the terms and conditions where you’ll be told exactly how long you have to take advantage of what’s on offer. Time limits can be generous, giving you 30 days to login and play, or they can be gone in a blink of an eye with only 24 hours to 3 days of validity. Make sure you have the time to play your spins before accepting them to avoid being disappointed.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are no-deposit free spins bonuses?</h2><p>As the name suggests, <a href=#>no-deposit free spins</a> are spins triggered without the need for players to make a deposit. You’ll usually find these kinds of offers used to tantalise potential new players into signing up to an online casino. You’ll be asked to register an account, and once you do, free spins will automatically be added for you to play with, BEFORE you even deposit a penny. The one thing you should be aware of is that no-deposit spins come with restrictions like wagering requirements. This means you’ll probably need to make a deposit anyway to win real money.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="Claim the no deposit free spins bonus without wagering requirements at MrQ (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Claim the no deposit free spins bonus without wagering requirements at MrQ</a>.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Can I use free spins bonuses in mobile UK casinos?</h2><p>These days, everything has to be optimised for mobile use because it's the most common way for users to interact with online products and services. Online casinos are no exception, and all quality operators have optimised their websites to respond perfectly on both desktop and mobile. Many <a href=#>top UK online casinos also have mobile apps</a> for Android and iOS that you can download from the App Store or Google Play. What this means is that free spin bonuses are interchangeable between mobile, desktop or tablet use, and will always be available regardless of the medium. In fact, players who download a casino app might even be treated to extra bonuses or free spin offers as an incentive.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>My top 5 tips for using free spins offers:</h2><ul><li><strong>Be on the lookout for wager-free spins</strong> - these offer pure value and you have absolutely nothing to lose, as you won't have to make a wagering contribution. Failing this, look out for free spin offers with the lowest wagering requirements possible.</li><li><strong>Choose sites with the most bonus games</strong> - Customers selecting a slot game to use your bonus funds on after registration, should do some research on the different games on offer. Feature-rich games give you a greater chance of hitting bonus games and multiplier rounds for larger wins.</li><li><strong>Choose a game with the highest RTP</strong> - Your casino bonus will sometimes allow you to choose from a range of different slots games. By selecting the one with the highest <a href=# aria-label="RTP (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">RTP</a>, you’re increasing your chances of a return on your bet spend.</li><li><strong>Use the maximum paylines possible</strong> - If you get the chance to customise your spins, crank up the paylines to the most allowed. This will increase your cost per spin, but it will also increase the size of your potential max win.</li><li><strong>Set a budget and stick to it </strong>- Many free spin offers will require you to make a qualifying deposit first. The number of free spins you can unlock with a deposit offer will often change, with more spins doled out the more you deposit. Don’t fall into the trap of depositing more than you can afford for the sake of unlocking additional spins.</li></ul><h2><strong>Remember to gamble responsibly</strong></h2><p><strong>A responsible gambler is someone who:</strong></p><ul><li>Establishes time and monetary limits before playing</li><li>Only gambles with money they can afford to lose</li><li>Never chase their losses</li><li>Doesn’t gamble if they’re upset, angry, or depressed</li><li>Gamcare –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamcare.org.uk</a></li><li>Gamble Aware –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.begambleaware.org</a></li></ul><p>Find our <a href=# aria-label="detailed guide on responsible gambling practices here (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed guide on responsible gambling practices here</a>.</p><p>For help with a gambling problem, call the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133 or go to&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamstop.co.uk</a>&nbsp;to be excluded from all UK-regulated gambling websites.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Betting</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jpucrayZo7RwfpFqbm1xYGx8p77EnmSsqJmjwG6uzqesrJ2jZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffree-spins-bonuses.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffree-spins-bonuses.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffree-spins-bonuses.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffree-spins-bonuses.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffree-spins-bonuses.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffree-spins-bonuses.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./connie-britton-ex-husband.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./connie-britton-ex-husband.html>Inside Connie Britton's Love Life Ex Husband John Britton</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./demi-moores-dating-history-a-timeline-of-her-marriages-flings.html>Demi Moores Dating History: A Timeline of Her Marriages, Flings</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./demi-moores-dating-history-a-timeline-of-her-marriages-flings.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
