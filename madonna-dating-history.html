As she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rolling Stone</a> during a 1984 interview, she met Gilroy at a party in 1979 and spent a few nights at an abandoned synagogue in Queens, New York, where he and his brother lived. "He stuck a guitar in my hand and tuned it to an open chord so that I could strum," she told the outlet. "That really clicked something off in my brain." She then cut back her dance classes to concentrate on singing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not long after, she was invited to travel to Paris to be a background singer and dancer for Patrick Hernandez. While abroad, she was lonely and felt unseen. She and Gilroy exchanged letters, which kept her going.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was my saving grace. His letters were so funny," she said. "He'd paint a picture of an American flag and write over it, like it was from the president, 'We miss you. You must return to America.' He really made me feel good."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When a bout with pneumonia forced Madonna to return to the states, she immediately got back in touch with Gilroy and worked with him for what she called a period of "intensive musical training."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was one of the happiest times of my life. I really felt loved. Sometimes I'd write sad songs and he'd sit there and cry," she said. "Very sweet."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the course of about a year, Madonna and Gilroy collaborated, and she eventually began to play drums for his and his brother Ed's band the Breakfast Club.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I stayed there so much, but I hadn't really moved there yet, and I remember when I said, 'Can I just live here, Dan?'

"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eventually, Madonna's drive to sing in the band drove a wedge between her and Gilroy, as well as Gilroy and his brother, and she left both the group and the relationship so she could pursue singing full-time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was just a lot more goal-oriented and commercial-minded than they were.

Penn was fined $1,000 and sentenced to a year of probation for the incident. A source close to the singer told PEOPLE: "The marriage had been undergoing stress all the time, but this was the first major stress, the first really traumatic episode for her. Wolinski was someone she knew, and it really shook her up."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Four months later, Penn got into scuffles with two photographers in New York. Around this time, Penn was reportedly jealous of model and singer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Nick Kamen</a>, who was working on a track called "Each Time You Break My Heart" with Madonna, and was convinced they were having an affair, despite Madonna's denial.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Dec. 4, 1987, Madonna filed for divorce from Penn. "There was no one direct incident leading up to this," her rep told PEOPLE. "It was a series of cumulative pressures. There were many moments in their marriage when it was shaky, and Madonna was finally forced to face the reality of the situation â€” that they weren't happy together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Los Angeles Times</a> reported that Madonna requested to withdraw her divorce filing within less than two weeks, but the pop star later filed for divorce for good in January 1989.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair have since remained friendly, and in December 2016, Madonna said she was "still in love" with Penn, even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>offering to remarry him</a> if he bid $150,000 in a charity auction.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tony-ward></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Tony Ward</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1990, Madonna dated model and actor Tony Ward, who costarred in her "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Justify My Love</a>" music video â€” which MTV banned for being too racy. Their romance was short-lived, however.
