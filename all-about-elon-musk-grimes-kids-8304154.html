While Musk and Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher, were public with their first pregnancy, they have since decided to keep the births of their children private amid their on-again, off-again relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, the pair <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>kept the birth of their third child secret</a> for over a year before news surfaced in journalist Walter Isaacson's biography, Elon Musk. Now, Grimes says she is focused on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>keeping the children “out of the public eye”</a> and making sure she has the best possible relationship with them as they grow up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I really <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>care about having a very good relationship</a> with my kids. I think I understand how to be a good parent to them. Both enforcing discipline and being their friend,” Grimes shared in an interview with Wired. “Who knows, maybe they’ll resent me and reject family culture, but I feel like they will not.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In October 2023, Grimes filed a petition <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>requesting to establish parental rights</a> for all three children, according to online records viewed by PEOPLE. A petition to establish parental rights is often a means of identifying who a child's legal parents are if they aren't married.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The filing came a month after the singer addressed headlines surrounding her co-parenting relationship with Musk, expressing her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>desire to "de-escalate the narrative"</a> surrounding her and her ex. In a lengthy post&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>on Twitter</a>&nbsp;(now known as X), Grimes also revealed that she had spoken to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Shivon Zilis</a> — the Neuralink exec who welcomed twins with Musk just weeks before Exa was born — after previously requesting that Zilis "unblock" her in a since-deleted post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We respect each other a lot and we're excited to become friends and have the kids grow up together," Grimes wrote of her relationship with Zilis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about Elon Musk and Grimes’ children.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-x--a-xii></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>X Æ A-Xii</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Elon Musk and son X at TIME Person of the Year in 2021.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Theo Wargo/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In January 2020, Grimes revealed she was pregnant with her first child by sharing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a topless photo that showed off her baby bump</a> on Instagram. In the comments of her post, she called “being knocked up” a “very feral & war-like state of being.” While she did not share who the father of the baby was at the time, she later <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>confirmed that Musk had fathered the infant</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“For a girl, it’s sacrificing your body and your freedom. It’s a pretty crazy sacrifice and only half of the population has to do it. It was really profound to me when I decided I was going to do it, to actually go through the act of unprotected sex,” she told Rolling Stone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I do actually just really love my boyfriend,” Grimes shared of Musk, explaining how she decided to welcome the idea of getting pregnant, “So I was like, ‘You know, sure.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On May 4, 2020, Grimes gave birth to the couple’s son, whom they named X Æ A-12. The musician explained that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the name had a lot of personal significance</a>, with X representing “the unknown variable” and Æ being her “elven spelling of Ai (love &/or Artificial intelligence).”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added that part of the name is a nod to the CIA’s Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance plane, “the precursor to SR-17” and the couple’s “favorite aircraft,” known to have “no weapons, no defenses, just speed.” Meanwhile, the “A” in the name also represents “Archangel,” which Grimes said is her “favorite song,” and the number “12” stands for the Chinese zodiac sign of the rat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just a few weeks later, Musk and Grimes announced that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>they had changed the infant’s name</a> to X Æ A-Xii, explaining that they had to remove “the numbers to confirm to California law.” Grimes added that after the change she thought the Roman numerals also looked “better.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the pair call the little boy “X” for short, they have shared various pronunciations of his full name. Both Grimes and Musk agree that “X” is spoken “like the letter,” but the musician says “Æ” is pronounced "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>like how you said the letter A then I</a>." Meanwhile, Musk shared on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>The Joe Rogan Experience</a> podcast that “the ‘Æ’ is pronounced like ‘ash.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As their son has gotten older, Grimes and Musk have kept his life mostly private but have shared small snippets about him. Ahead of his first birthday, Grimes posted a sweet video of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>X playing with her synth</a> and later revealed that he was very into “radical art.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve watched Apocalypse Now and stuff with my baby. He's into radical art. Like, he just actually is, and I don't think it's problematic to engage with them on that level," she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Times</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that year, Grimes revealed that X does not call her “mom” and instead calls her by her first name, Claire. Grimes explained that she doesn’t “identify” with the word mother and that X had never called her that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“X, he says Claire but he doesn't say, like, mama … Like, maybe he can sense my distaste for the word mother. Which I don't even know why I have a distaste for it ’cause I respect it. I just, I can't identify with it weirdly,” Grimes said in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>an interview with Vogue</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Elon Musk and X Musk.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Elon Musk Twitter</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2022, X made headlines as he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>joined his father in the office</a> amid his planned acquisition of Twitter. According to The Washington Post, X was running around the office while tense discussions were underway and Musk had taken over the conference room for his son, with the room reportedly “strewn with toys.” Musk even shared a photo of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>X’s official employee badge</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While some outlets framed the situation as inappropriate, Grimes said she was happy that X could join his father at work, after previously revealing that Musk <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sees the little boy as his “protégé.”</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We shud normalize having kids in adult work spaces. Baby joy is contagious for adults, amazing to have at work and they learn so much.&nbsp; Win win for all. X shadows engineering/ strategy meetings. can identify obscure rocket design, knows all abt grid fins, entry burns, robots,” Grimes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>shared on social media</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since then, X has continued to develop his passion for spacecraft, with Grimes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>calling him a “little engineer.”</a> In an interview with Wired, she explained that it’s hard to buy him toys as he gets upset when they’re not “anatomically correct.” It got to a point where she admits she was worried about his “obsession with space,” especially after he witnessed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>SpaceX's Starship rocket explode</a> after takeoff in April 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“X knows a lot about rockets. It's crazy. He knows more about rockets than me,” she told the outlet. “When X saw Starship blow up, he had, like, a three-day PTSD meltdown. Every hour, he was waking up and going, ‘Starship … ’ and I had to rub his back.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-exa-dark-siderl></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Exa Dark Sideræl</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Exa Musk.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Grimes Twitter&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In December 2021, Musk and Grimes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>secretly welcomed a daughter</a> via surrogate. News of their new addition didn’t surface until March 2022, when Grimes opened up about the little girl in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Vanity Fair</a>. In the cover story, Grimes revealed that they named her Exa Dark Sideræl but call her Y for short. Although Grimes wanted to name the infant Odysseus after a girl she’d seen in her dreams, the couple ultimately agreed on Y.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like her big brother, Y’s name has significance to her parents. Exa refers to the supercomputing term exaFLOPS, while Dark represents “the unknown.” Grimes explained, “People fear it but truly it's the absence of photons. Dark matter is the beautiful mystery of our universe.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, Sideræl is pronounced “sigh-deer-ee-el” and is a “more elven” spelling of sidereal. According to Grimes, it means “the true time of the universe, star time, deep space time, not our relative earth time.” It also has a double meaning and is a tribute to Grimes’ favorite Lord of the Rings character, Galadriel, who “chooses to abdicate the ring.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for the little girl’s nickname, Grimes explained <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>in a social media post</a> that she’s called “Y” or “ ‘Why?’ or just ‘?’ ” although she noted that the “government won't recognize that.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since her birth, Grimes and Musk have kept many other details of Y’s life private. Grimes has only shared small glimpses into the little girl’s life, sharing that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she loves techno music</a>, especially the musician Boris Brejcha.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My daughter is dancing to techno over this copy of the birth of tragedy by Nietzsche - what a queen,” Grimes tweeted alongside a photo of the then-9-month-old leaning on a bench in a black onesie with a pink bow headband in her blonde hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Grimes has also shared that Y is following in her brother X’s footsteps and is a “little engineer” like him. While X is focused on rockets, Grimes told Wired that Y likes “industrial shipping” — admitting that her daughter is a “little strange.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-techno-mechanicus></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Techno Mechanicus</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Grimes and Elon Musk at the 2018 MET Gala.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Taylor Hill/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September 2023, it was revealed that Musk and Grimes had secretly welcomed a third child in 2022. According to journalist Walter Isaacson's biography about Musk, the pair welcomed a son named Techno Mechanicus, who also goes by “Tau.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Tau is so amazing. He came out with eyes that could just see so deeply into your soul, with so much knowledge. He looks like a little Spock. He's definitely a Vulcan,” Grimes told Isaacson in the biography.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not much else is known about the little boy — and Grimes would like to keep it that way.
