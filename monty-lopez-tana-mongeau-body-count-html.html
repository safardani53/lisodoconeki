After that, many users started circulating posts on Facetime,&nbsp; TikTok and Instagram of him flirting with younger women. After such posts went public, Ash told <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Page Six</a>&nbsp;in July 2022 that such stories had broken her heart and she was hurt because she thought that they were deeply in love. She also alleged that Monty "misled" him into having an affair by lying to her that his marriage with Sheri was already over.&nbsp;</strong><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><strong>“He told me that we were going to be together and have babies together,” she added. “He even introduced me to his mom, his youngest brother and I thought we had something real. He told me a story of his marriage that convinced me that they were apart and in the process of getting a divorce.”</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>As things unfolded, both Rae and his estranged wife Sheri unfollowed him on social media.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ash also finally decided to&nbsp;break up with him when she watched leaked<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> footage online of Lopez allegedly touching a girl's backside during a party</a>.

And <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ava Louise</a>&nbsp;also had weighed in on the equation blaming Sheri for her divorce with Monty.</strong></p><p><strong>In an interview with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Seventeen</a> in 2017, Addison Rae had revealed that her parents have been&nbsp;separated many times and also divorced before remarrying in 2017.</strong></p><p><strong>As of now, Lopez seems to be single.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>It looks like Monty Lopez is done staying silent and has a lot&nbsp;to <a href=# rel=follow>say about his wife</a> and everyone else on social media.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On August 8, 2022, he took to Instagram to spark conversation on <a href=# rel=follow>Tana Mongeau</a>'s body count.</p><p>“We got a little excitement going on in the realm of social media, but I got a question for everybody...is Tana’s body count above or below 300?” wondered Lopez in his story.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But that was not the most alarming part. After the video caught Mongeau’s attention, the internet personality commented on the video,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">writing</a>, “I am calling the police.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Lopez was unfazed by Mongeau’s comment and asked her if she was talking about her body count. He even told her to take a bath instead.&nbsp;</p><p>Mongeau and Lopez’s exchange was screen grabbed and shared by tea page tiktokinsiders. In the comment section of the post, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">commented</a>, “if she calls the cops, they will take her away for the count.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p></p><p><strong>Monty Lopez talks about Tana Mongeau's body count in his Instagram story. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>It looks like the father of three is excited about the drama because, in another post uploaded by the outlet, he wrote, “let’s freaking go.”</p><h2>Tana Mongeau Responds to Monty Lopez’s Body Count Comment</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>After realizing that Lopez was not taking the situation seriously, Mongeau took to the Instagram story and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spilled some tea</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><p>She said it was not fun and games, noting it was one of the most embarrassing TikToks she had seen this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Mongeau explained she had held back during this <a href=# rel=follow>entire scandal</a>, but she was no longer doing that since Lopez wanted to beef with her.&nbsp;</p><p>“But clearly, he wants to beef. I mean, firstly, why would a grown man, a father, is even remotely discussing my body count is beyond me. We have all seen paparazzi videos of him stalking me to get a selfie with me,” said Mongeau.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Besides the stalking, the internet personality noted she was also weary of getting text messages and face time from Lopez.</p><p>She even claimed that Lopez kept trying to hit on her girlfriends and insinuated she had seen him do drugs one too many times at several teenage events.</p><p>She continued exposing Lopez, claiming she had to back him off multiple times from her friends' houses and bedrooms when they were scared of him.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span><p>Mongeau did not explain further and alluded she would reveal everything in a podcast session with Jeff Wittek. She then ended her rant by saying she hoped to&nbsp;see Lopez “in jail or court.”</p><h2>Tana Mongeau Exposes DM about Lopez</h2><p>After her story went live, Mongeau took a step further and revealed a DM she had gotten from one of her followers about Lopez.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The DM read, “one time I was at a party, and Monty came up to me and asked if I was '[sleeping] with him' and then went out back to do some coke.” Mongeau had also tagged Lopez in the story. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Netizens were shocked by Lopez’s behavior and sympathized with his uber-famous daughter, <a href=# rel=follow>Addison Rae</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“I can’t even imagine how Addison is dealing with this, I would lose my mind if my dad was pulling something like this,” a user worried for Rae.&nbsp;</p><p>“He is so creepy, I’m sorry.
