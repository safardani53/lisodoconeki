His career over three decades has seen him reporting from media giants like CNN and its rival network Fox News. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>While his presence in television has amassed his fame and reputation, it has also brought attention to his personal life and relationship status.</p><h2>He Once Dated Dara Tomanovich</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Hemmer was in an enduring relationship with Canadian model&nbsp;Dara Tomanovich. The pair <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started</a>&nbsp;dating in 2005, the year when they were spotted together at Victoria's Secret fashion show in New York City.&nbsp;</p><p>They kept their relationship fairly private, appearing together in events only once in a blue moon. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In December 2009, Hemmer and his girlfriend attended a reception for <a href=# rel=follow>Dr. Sanjay Gupta's</a> Book at Rogue Tomate in New York City.&nbsp;Their last public appearance came in 2013 when they went to a&nbsp;Gala at City Centre in Berlin.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The duo reportedly called it quits in 2013.</p><p>A year after the split,&nbsp;Tomanovich <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">made</a>&nbsp;headlines for crashing her Porsche in Manhattan. She was arrested for&nbsp;driving while intoxicated and later released without bail. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>His Relationship Status and Gay Rumors&nbsp;</h2><p>Since his split with&nbsp;Tomanovich, Hemmer has kept his personal life under wraps. Unlike his ex-girlfriend who is back to dating, he has never been romantically linked to any woman.&nbsp;</p><p>His social media accounts on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter are also void of glimpses of his&nbsp;love life. The accounts only feature his job and career.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Because of his privacy, Hemmer is timely speculated&nbsp;to be gay. But judging someone's inclination based on his approachability would be inappropriate. Anyway, his now-defunct relationship helps more or less to dispel the rumors.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Also Read:</u>&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Is Graham Bensinger Gay? Personal Life Insights</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>How He Got into Journalism</h2><p>Born on November 14, 1964, Hemmer grew up in Ohio as the middle child amid five children.</p><p>His <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">parents</a>, father William R. Hemmer and mother&nbsp;Georganne M. Knittle, did their best to educate him. His father ran the family with his job as a mattress manufacturing company's executive. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Hemmer did his schooling from a&nbsp;Catholic parochial school&nbsp;Our Lady of Victory. Later, he joined&nbsp;Elder High School. During his senior year, he started a 15-minute radio program with his friend for the institution. The small step&nbsp;sprouted a passion of broadcasting in him.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, he chose broadcast journalism as his major subject for his bachelor's at Miami University and continued his study in Europe with the help of a fraternity program.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hemmer's Career In Fox News</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Hemmer <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">got</a>&nbsp;into professional journalism in the mid-1980s, joining WLWT-TV as a sports producer. Soon after, he joined&nbsp;CBS-associated network WCPO-TV as a weekend sports anchor.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>At 26, he left all his jobs&nbsp;and stepped into a year-long journey, backpacking to&nbsp;China, Vietnam, Nepal, India, and Eastern Europe. In Calcutta, India, he worked for a children's&nbsp;clinic run by Mother Teresa&nbsp;for two weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>He documented his journey through media and reports to form a piece titled&nbsp;Bill's Excellent Adventure. The Ohio native also shared his knowledge from the trip with CBS.</p><p>After returning from his journey, Hemmer joined CNN in 1995. In his ten-year-long tenure with CNN, he hosted multiple programs such as&nbsp;American Morning&nbsp;alongside <a href=# rel=follow>Paula Zahn</a>, CNN Tonight, and CNN Morning News. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He also covered major events, among which&nbsp;the coverage of the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta earned him an Emmy Award.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2005, Hemmer left CNN and joined its rival Fox News as a founding co-anchor of America's Newsroom. He left the show later and started hosting&nbsp;afternoon newscast&nbsp;Bill Hemmer Reports&nbsp;in 2020. As a chief anchor, he also served breaking news and significant events.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2021, he moved back to hosting&nbsp;America's Newsroom&nbsp;alongside <a href=# rel=follow>Dana Perino</a>. He now <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">earns</a>&nbsp;a salary of $3 million&nbsp;and has a net worth of $9&nbsp;million, as per Celebrity Net Worth.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e2rbiMoZympZWneqit2GakmqqinrKledainZ5ll56%2FrbLRopynnF2ZrrW1zaBkrKCZp8GtsdKsZaGsnaE%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbill-hemmer-gay-married-wife-girlfriend-dating-shirtless-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbill-hemmer-gay-married-wife-girlfriend-dating-shirtless-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbill-hemmer-gay-married-wife-girlfriend-dating-shirtless-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbill-hemmer-gay-married-wife-girlfriend-dating-shirtless-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbill-hemmer-gay-married-wife-girlfriend-dating-shirtless-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbill-hemmer-gay-married-wife-girlfriend-dating-shirtless-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./santa-ynez-villa-sunstone-winery-vanderpump-rules.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./santa-ynez-villa-sunstone-winery-vanderpump-rules.html>All the Details on Sunstone Winery &amp;amp; Villa From 'Vanderpump Rules'?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-joshua-sasse-dating.html>Who is Joshua Sasse Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-joshua-sasse-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
