He left that form right behind when landing a hot contest at Newbury last time. He looked a natural over fences there and can take another step forward in testing ground that suits.</p><p>Fiddlerontheroof is well up to this standard and will be no pushover. He is stepped up in trip here after a solid second at Ascot last time and is proven in the conditions.</p><p>Golan Fortune was far from disgraced in a Kempton Grade 1 on Boxing Day when a late mistake cost him third. He stays well but needs more.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p><strong>2.25</strong></p><p><strong>JAY BEE WHY</strong> deserves this hike in class after he destroyed his rivals to win by ten lengths on his hurdles debut here. He easily saw off a Nicky Henderson hotpot and loved the testing ground. Alan King knows what he’s got and he should be right there.</p><p>Adrimel was in front a long way out at Haydock last month but kept going well for an easy success. That built on his opening win at Sandown and this longer trip should be fine.</p><p>Make Me A Believer battled to score at Cheltenham and has more to come on his third crack over timber.</p><p>Oscar Elite is a proven stayer who has won both his runs at Chepstow and is respected. Sending Love is better than we saw in a Grade 2 last time when he travelled well for a long way.</p><p>This is a hotter race than Midnight River won at Leicester but he’s a proven mudlark who can’t be discounted.</p><p><strong>3.00</strong></p><p><strong>NOTACHANCE</strong> has every chance after taking a big step forward at Bangor last time. He relished the heavy ground at the Welsh track and had plenty left in the tank at the end of three miles. The handicapper hasn’t gone mad with a 7lb rise and he looks a real marathon runner.</p><p>Last year’s second Captain Chaos hasn’t fired this season but he goes back up to a proper trip in ground he likes which can rekindle his spark.</p><p>Storm Control is in top form with a couple of good Cheltenham wins. He has run badly on all three visits to Warwick but looks a much better horse now.</p><p>Le Breuil has lots of stamina and was a fair third in the Becher Chase last time. He’s had a wind op since then and likes soft ground and could well better last year’s fifth in this race.</p><p>Walk In The Mill is an Aintree specialist who had a rare tumble there last time. He needs his best off this mark.</p><p>The Hollow Ginge looks overpriced. He unseated in the Welsh National after a good run in the Ladbrokes Trophy at Newbury. He’s hit and miss but would have a chance if finding his A-game.</p><p><strong>3.35</strong></p><p><strong>COME ON TEDDY</strong> blitzed his rivals at Cheltenham when travelling like a top-class hurdler. He coped nicely with the soft ground and saw out three miles well. That was just his third handicap outing and there’s more to come.</p><p>Espion didn’t get the run of the race at Sandown last time and can improve on his sixth place there. Imperial Alcazar looked rusty at Haydock back from a long break last time. He relishes these conditions and trainer Fergal O’Brien continues to fire in winners.</p><p>Welsh National winner Potters Corner has decent hurdles form too and is only 3lb higher than his last win over a similar trip to this.</p><p>Tobefair is right up the weights but has won this race before so could hit the frame.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/801ebee8-7866-4f85-acdf-2d042b444cab.jpg><p><strong>MARKET RASEN</strong></p><p><strong>2.05</strong></p><p><strong>EDWARDSTONE</strong> goes back over timber after unseating when well backed for his chase debut last time out. That is no bad thing as he was an excellent sixth in the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle at Cheltenham last March. He came back this season with a good fifth back at Prestbury Park when testing ground suited well. He has winning form at Aintree so this flatter track should be right up his street. This trip suits and he looks the one to beat.</p><p>Oscars Leader is consistent and followed up a Sandown second with a narrow defeat at Haydock last month. He goes from the front and may be able to slip this small field from what looks a fair enough handicap mark.</p><p>Langer Dan has had a wind operation since his disappointing effort at Plumpton in November. He looked a real prospect in 2019 when winning a Wetherby Listed contest. He hasn’t had a lot of racing since but was sixth in the Fred Winter so has enough ability to figure at this level.</p><p>Crooks Peak has had a little help from the handicapper but was poor at Kempton latest while Rowland Ward needs to raise his game at this level after a poor run at Cheltenham.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: £20 Risk free Bet - <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Betfair: Bet £5 Get £20 - <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>Paddy Power: £20 Risk Free Bet: New customers only.

Trip and ground are ideal so only coming back quickly can stop him.</p><p>Lil Rockerfeller continues to perform but it’s more than two years since he won a race. He was nailed in the dying strides at Newbury last time and will have no problem coping with these conditions. The slight drop in trip may help too.</p><p>Mohaayed is another on a long losing run but he’s looked capable of winning since being upped to this trip and Dan Skelton is in good form.</p><p>Keeper Hill has been running in Graded chases with little success this season. His hurdles form looks a little short of these rivals but he does stay well.</p><p><strong>3.15</strong></p><p><strong>GRANGEE</strong> looked the real deal when winning on her debut at Galway last time. She coasted along before skipping away from her rivals. Irish champion Willie Mullins is the king of bumpers and he can repeat last year’s win.</p><p>Unbeaten Eileendover looks the biggest threat given her two victories have come by a total of 45 lengths. She’s getting weight thanks to her age and quickened like a smart filly at Wetherby last time.</p><p>Miss Lamb also has a 100% record and had a bit in hand last time. This is tougher but she has more to come. Heavy ground winner Merry Mistress looks best of the rest.</p><h4>FREE BETS <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GET OVER £2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE</a></h4><p>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
