The couple have been dating since 2021, and while the two have shared a few birthday shout-outs and photos of each other on social media, they generally keep their relationship pretty private.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Anjos isn't just the model's boyfriend, though: He is a musician who has worked with huge artists and received some pretty big accolades. Anjos began RAC, or Remix Artist Collective, in 2007 with other remixers he had met online.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, the Grammy winner has his hands full between his thriving music career and Good Times, the cafe and wine bar he opened with Baldwin in 2022. The soon-to-be parents are also busy getting ready for the birth of their child, which they celebrated with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>strip club baby shower</a> in March.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Baldwin, whose parents are former couple <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alec Baldwin</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kim Basinger</a>, revealed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>the baby's name</a> during an appearance on Girlboss Radio. "We're naming her Holland. I'm Ireland, so [we chose] another country name because we wanted to keep that consistent," she explained. "And then I love the actress <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Holland Taylor</a>.

According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rolling Stone</a>, he was born in Coimbra, Portugal, to an American mother and Portuguese father, whose work took them around the country until they settled outside Porto.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Riff magazine</a> that he moved to Pennsylvania for third and fourth grade, then moved back to Portugal. "All things considered, I had a pretty good childhood," he told the outlet. "I had a bit of a weird childhood in a sense that my parents are missionaries. I grew up in a very religious environment."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Anjos eventually moved to the states for good in 2005, he said that Portuguese culture had a big impact on his art. "Dance music was such a popular thing [in Portugal]," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>All Access Music</a> in 2014. "In the U.S., people kinda take it for granted, because it's so ubiquitous.

In 2020, he released his third original album, Boy; his prior releases include 2014's Strangers and 2017's Ego.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">RAC has gone on tour, performed at music festivals like Coachella and frequently collaborates with other popular artists — his single "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Cheap Sunglasses</a>" featured songwriter and producer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Matthew Koma</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His musicianship dates back to childhood. In a 2021 interview with Rolling Stone, he shared that he started taking piano lessons before he turned 7, discovered the guitar as a teen and played in "all kinds of bands." In 2001, he learned about Napster, the popular file-sharing app known for peer-to-peer music distribution, and discovered the music world outside of Portugal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Flipboard</a>, Anjos described his sound: "I like experimenting with new styles and trying new things. At its core, [it's] pop music, but outside of that a little bit of dance music, house, a little disco — it's all over the place."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-started-out-as-a-remixer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>He started out as a remixer</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before releasing his own original music, Anjos was famous for his remixes, which is how he started out in the industry. In the beginning, he worked with a few other remixers, but it slowly became a solo project.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Patreon</a>, he started making remixes in 2005 while studying music business at Greenville College in Illinois, where he made remixes of artists like The Killers to post on YouTube. Since then, RAC's remixes have racked up millions of plays on SoundCloud and topped the charts. He's remixed artists like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Bob Marley</a>, Kings of Leon, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Lana Del Rey</a> and Death Cab for Cutie, just to name a few.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some of his favorite remixes were his first for The Shins, telling Flipboard that it "changed [his] life," and the Lana Del Rey remix that was "still one of the most requested tracks."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2017, Anjos won his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>first Grammy</a>, taking home the award for best-remixed recording for the remix of Bob Moses' "Tearing Me Up." He was also nominated in that category in 2016 and 2021.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-and-baldwin-live-in-oregon></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>He and Baldwin live in Oregon</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>RAC Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Anjos moved to Portland, Oregon, in 2009 with his ex, per <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Oregonian</a>. Baldwin relocated there from Los Angeles in 2020.

In January 2023, Baldwin shared <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>how hard her pregnancy had been</a>, writing, "It takes so much out of you.

In November 2022, the pair announced they were opening a boutique, cafe and bar called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Good Times</a>, which would operate both online and at their brick-and-mortar location in Gearhart, Oregon. The lifestyle brand sells products from women- and Black-owned small businesses, and the cafe-bar combo serves wine and food.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Baldwin <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Eater</a>: "Most of the brands we're working with are my friends.

He created a dedicated <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Spotify playlist</a> for the space, adding, "I'm picking songs that set a very specific tone.

According to Rolling Stone, in 2020, he released 100 cassette tapes that could only be purchased with his own personal crypto token. The $20 tapes were resold for as much as $13,000. His first audiovisual NFT, a 30-second art loop, sold for $26,000.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The crypto world has become a passion of his. In 2021, he launched a creative agency called "6" that aimed to help other artists navigate the crypto-based business and storytelling world.
