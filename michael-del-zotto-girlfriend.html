<time>01 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>The 2019 Stanley Cup champ Michael Del Zottos’ girlfriend & dating status is the center of fans’ query, especially after his not-so-well connection with adult film actress Lisa Ann came forth in 2014.</strong></p><p>Ann took to Twitter to shame & mock Zotto, who reportedly asked her to be an escort for dates with other girls, even though they were dating then.</p><p>The relationship talks of the NHL’s Anaheim Ducks star don’t end here.</p><p>He was once rumored to be in a relationship with Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, wife of Prince Harry.</p><p>A bitter yet controversial past of the ice hockey player surged curiosity over his current girlfriend- if he is dating.</p><p>With that being said, there are no questions about his abilities in the rink, though.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canadian-Born-NHL-Player-Michael-Del-Zotto.jpg><p>Currently, Michael Del Zotto is under contract with the Anaheim Ducks of the NHL. He played the 2022-23 season with its AHL affiliate San Diego Gulls.</p><p>Zotto previously played for other NHL teams: Philadelphia Flyers, New York Rangers, St. Louis Blues & Vancouver Canucks.</p><p>With the St. Louis Blues, he won the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals over the Boston Bruins, alongside <a href=#>Jay Bouwmeester</a>, <a href=#>Vladimir Tarasenko</a>, & <a href=#>Patrick Maroon</a>, among others.&nbsp;</p><p>Born on June 24, 1990, the Whitchurch-Stouffville, Ontario native is the youngest of two sons of Steven Del Zotto & Lee Del Zotto.</p><p>His father, Steven, is a former collegiate football player who played at York University & was the 1986 CFL Draft pick of the Toronto Argonauts.</p><p>It explains where the athletic trait of the St. Andrew’s College attendant Zotto comes from.</p><h2>Michael Del Zotto Girlfriend: Is He Dating Anyone?</h2><p>A successful ice hockey player with a toned physique, Zotto undeniably, is a heartthrob of many.</p><p>There are lots of assumptions that the NHL defenseman has a girlfriend & goes on Instagram post-spree about their dating. But it seems the truth is far from that.</p><p>It’s possible that, given his controversial past relationships, Michael Del Zotto likes to keep his romance away from the spotlight.</p><p>As far as the evidence from his social media posts & online sources suggests, the Canadian ice hockey star is not dating anyone or has had a girlfriend in recent years.</p><p>Previously, the 6 feet tall Anaheim Ducks player was in a relationship/rumored romance with three girls: Meghan Markle, Lisa Ann, and Amber Ryne.</p><h2>Rumored Link With Meghan Markle- Did It Break Markle’s First Marriage?</h2><p>In 2013, the Canadian ice hockey star was <a href=# rel=noopener>linked with Megan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex</a> & wife of Prince Harry.</p><p>Amid the rumored relationship between Markle & Michael, she divorced her then-husband Trevor Engelson, a film director, in August 2013. They were married for only two years.</p><p>It raised criticism & queries if Mrs. Markle cheated on her beau to be with the NHL star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Meghan-With-Her-Friend-At-Michael-Game-Source-SportsInternational.jpg><p>The concerns about the alleged liaison came as Megan attended Zotto’s game two times a few months before her divorce.</p><p>The first game was on April 8, 2013, in Toronto vs the Maple Leafs. On April 22 that year, she flew to New York to attend Zotto’s game & called him “the best.”</p><p>However, the representatives of both Michael and Meghan denied their relationship.</p><p>Meghan’s spokesman added: “In fact, she was never alone with him, and Mr. Del Zotto has absolutely nothing to do with the end of her marriage.”</p><p>Interestingly, when asked about Meghan’s alleged affair with Del Zotto, her ex-husband Trevor said, “Who? Oh, him. I don’t have anything to say about it. I just can’t”.</p><p>Even though these claims & subtle indicators bring no truth forward, it did cause a lot of commotion in the media then.</p><h2>Adult Film Star Slammed Zotto On Twitter</h2><p>The Canadian ice hockey player had also been associated with adult film actress Lisa Ann.</p><p>According to Lisa’s Tweet, the two met at an event where he reached out to a promoter to meet her- a story of 2012.</p><p>After that, they went on a date, but about a week later, Zotto asked his date, Ann, if she could hook him up with other girls.</p><p>As a result, Ann & Michael would part ways, but upon their rekindling their romance after a year, the NHL star would do the same.</p><p>So, Lisa Ann took to Twitter in November 2014 & shamed the then-Flyers defenseman by posting a series of embarrassing messages, he reportedly asked her to arrange dates with other girls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lisa-Ann-Tweets-Source-Twitter.jpg><p>The adult film actress even said that since she tweeted his story, hundreds of girls had come out to tell her he did the same thing to them as well.</p><p>Moreover, her account got support from another adult film star named Amber Ryne.<br>Amber Ryne tweeted saying, “Hahaha, he did this to me too.. not appreciated.”</p><p>Sadly, there is not much information about his dating life with Amber Ryne.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC5yJyfmp2cYrGmuIyzpq2sn2K0qr7Ln6minZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-del-zotto-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmichael-del-zotto-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmichael-del-zotto-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmichael-del-zotto-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-del-zotto-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-del-zotto-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jamal-musiala.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jamal-musiala.html>Jamal Musiala [2024 Update]: Early Life, Parents &amp;amp; Salary</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./a9c63858-df76-9383-f61c-c2d24a00ce06.html>Watch Beverly Hills, 90210 Season 10 Episode 25: I'm Happy For You, Really</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./a9c63858-df76-9383-f61c-c2d24a00ce06.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
