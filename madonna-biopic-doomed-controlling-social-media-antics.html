Sun.&nbsp;</p><p>The project was scrapped this week by Universal Pictures after the <a href=#>Queen of Pop</a>, 64, announced a <a href=#>major world tour</a>, although the decision is believed to have been made before that.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/1990-wearing-jean-paul-gaultier-745788659.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/madonna-instagram-781427676.jpg><p>First green-lit in 2020, it was set to be directed and co-written by the Like a Virgin star herself.</p><p>But the mom-of-six’s controversial and bizarre posts on <a href=#>social media</a> left Universal bosses “scratching their heads”, a well-placed <a href=#>Tinseltown</a> source with knowledge of the matter told <a href=#>The U.S. Sun</a>.</p><p>And her insistence meanwhile on retaining “near-total” control of the project proved a bridge too far and doomed it, according to the insider.</p><p>The source explained: "Madonna did herself no favors by acting weird on social media during&nbsp;this entire process.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more entertainment">Read more entertainment</h2><p>“She signed a contract to make this film and that&nbsp;should have been the signal to her to stop the circus antics, stop&nbsp;chasing likes, and just buckle down and get this movie into shape.&nbsp;</p><p>“Her&nbsp;funny Instagram posts are always catnip for her die-hard fans but they&nbsp;didn't play well at Universal.&nbsp;</p><p>“The studio bosses were watching what&nbsp;Madonna posted over these months where she was supposed to be writing&nbsp;and were left scratching their heads.”</p><h2>'I'M UNCOMFORTABLE'</h2><p>Madonna’s recent social media controversies have included posting a racy video of herself in lingerie alongside a wholesome pic of her four youngest on <a href=#>Christmas Day</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>The post quickly got hundreds of thousands of views, with one critic commenting: “I’m uncomfortable.”</p><p>Fans had already previously been left confused earlier in December when she posted a video wearing a black lace balaclava while holding a riding crop.&nbsp;</p><p>The previous month, Madonna left fans disgusted after posting a <a href=#>video showing her licking water out of a dog bowl </a>after posing suggestively with bottles of <a href=#>sriracha</a> and mustard.</p><p>She also took to her social media accounts lip-syncing to a rap about punching people in their “motherf**king face” with the caption: “Alright, wait, bitch.”</p><p>In October, the <a href=#>Michigan</a>-born star left many confused when she appeared to come out as gay before making the bizarre “confession” that she has never been circumcised.&nbsp;</p><p>And in April, she sparked concern with a <a href=#>TikTok video ahead of the Grammy Awards</a>, which she filmed in a very see-through top and with what some described as a weird "frozen face."</p><h2>'A BRIDGE TOO FAR'</h2><p>The odd antics all came as full-time work writing and casting the biopic project was ongoing.&nbsp;</p><p>Following arduous auditions for the coveted role, <a href=#>Ozark</a> actress <a href=#>Julia Garner</a>, 28, was cast to play Madonna in June last year.&nbsp;</p><p>Young stars who also went through auditions included <a href=#>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a> actress <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney</a>, 25, and <a href=#>Don’t Worry Darling</a> star <a href=#>Florence Pugh</a>, 27, among others.</p><p>The casting process was described as a boot camp where actresses were drilled with grueling 11-hour choreography sessions directed by Madonna.&nbsp;</p><p>They also underwent readings with Madonna and further auditions where they had to sing in front of her.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, on the writing front, Oscar-winning Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody was initially brought on to pen the script.</p><p>But in April 2021, <a href=#>The Sun reported that Cody, 44, had quit after finding Madonna too difficult to work with</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The U.S. Sun’s source said: "From day one, the thing this movie needed was a strong hand on the&nbsp;wheel in addition to Madonna.&nbsp;</p><p>“The hope in 2020 was that would be&nbsp;Diablo Cody, who has directed some cool movies in addition to being an&nbsp;Oscar-winning screenwriter.&nbsp;</p><p>“But Diablo was only involved with helping&nbsp;to write the first draft and had to leave to tend to her other&nbsp;projects, as well as her duties as a mom.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was an uphill battle after&nbsp;she left, even though Madonna insisted on doing more writing herself.&nbsp;</p><p>“Madonna as co-screenwriter was always going to be a hurdle but Madonna&nbsp;as director of the movie was probably a bridge too far in hindsight.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“Madonna negotiated for near-total control of the project, and that’s&nbsp;the thing that doomed it."</p><p>The U.S. Sun reached out asking for comment from reps for Madonna, Universal, Julia Garner, Sydney Sweeney, and Florence Pugh but did not hear back.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
