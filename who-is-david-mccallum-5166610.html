The Scottish actor, best known for his work on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NCIS</a>, reportedly passed away of natural causes while surrounded by family at New York Presbyterian Hospital.</p><p data-v-6b73e26c>“David was a gifted actor and author, and beloved by many around the world. He led an incredible life, and his legacy will forever live on through his family and the countless hours on film and television that will never go away,” CBS said in a statement.</p><p data-v-6b73e26c>His son, <strong>Peter McCallum</strong>, also shared a statement on behalf of the family. “He was the kindest, coolest, most patient and loving father,” he said. “He always put family before self. He looked forward to any chance to connect with his grandchildren, and had a unique bond with each of them. He and his youngest grandson, <strong>Whit</strong>, 9, could often be found in the corner of a room at family parties having deep philosophical conversations.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He was a true renaissance man — he was fascinated by science and culture and would turn those passions into knowledge,” Peter’s statement continued. “For example, he was capable of conducting a symphony orchestra and (if needed) could actually perform an autopsy, based on his decades-long studies for his role on NCIS.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“After returning from the hospital to their apartment, I asked my mother if she was OK before she went to sleep. Her answer was simply, ‘Yes. But I do wish we had had a chance to grow old together’,” Peter added. “She is 79, and dad just turned 90. The honesty in that emotion shows how vibrant their beautiful relationship and daily lives were, and that somehow, even at 90, Daddy never grew old.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Find out more about David and the incredible legacy he leaves behind below.</p><h2>He Started His Acting Career in the 1950s</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/david-mccallum-5-things-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>After appearing in a number of films and shows, David first stepped into the big acting spotlight when he played the role of&nbsp;secret agent&nbsp;Illya Kuryakin&nbsp;in the television series&nbsp;<i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E</i>.

Let’s raise a jug and celebrate a funny fantastic authentic man,” he wrote. “I’ve only got 3 autographs. Connery, Tony Bennett and McCallum. I felt the same way as Steve McQueen in this picture from The Great Escape: Wow! It’s David McCallum! No one did it better. We were lucky to have him bring us Ducky. Let’s send all the love in the world to his beautiful family. Rest In Peace David.”</span></p><h2>He Is Survived by a Big Family</h2><p data-v-6b73e26c>David is survived by his wife of 56 years, <strong>Katherine McCallum</strong>, his sons<strong> Paul McCallum</strong>, <strong>Valentine McCallum</strong> and Peter, his daughter <strong>Sophie McCallum</strong>.
