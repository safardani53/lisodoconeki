This is a hike in class but there should be a lot more to come from Brian Meehan’s youngster.<br>Rosallion shouldn’t be written off despite his disappointment at Donny last time.</p><p>He looked a hot prospect when scoring at Ascot in July and this quicker ground should suit.</p><p>Unquestionable didn’t get the breaks in the Phoenix Stakes last time after a good effort in the Railway and can bounce back.</p><p>Zabiari was a Group 3 winner here latest and is respected.</p><p>1.50: <strong>DARNATION </strong>took her form to a new level when winning the May Hill Stakes at Doncaster last time.</p><p>She picked up well there and saw out the mile strongly. Provided this isn’t coming too soon for Karl Burke’s filly, she’ll go close.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p>Opera Singer had almost seven lengths in hand when winning the Flame Of Tara at The Curragh for Aidan O’Brien. She can figure on this hike in grade.</p><p>Les Pavots looks the pick of the home team after winning a Deauville Group 2 last time.</p><p>That was over seven furlongs and this longer distance should be ideal.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Tote: Bet £5 Get £20 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Virgin Bet: Bet £10 Get £20 in free bets - <a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Betfair</strong>:<strong> Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: Bet £20 and get it back as Cash if it Loses</strong> - <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Sky Bet: <strong>Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Horse Racing Bets</strong> </strong>- <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>Tote: New customers online only.

He goes on any ground and has enough class to go close.</p><p>Westover can improve on last year’s seventh and looks a threat along with French Derby hero Ace Impact and Hukum who will hope the ground doesn’t dry out too much.</p><p>German Derby winner Fantastic Moon is another to note each-way.</p><p>But what does the man who won it last year think?</p><p>Luke Morris, who memorably rode Alpinista to victory, told <a href=# aria-label="OLBG (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">OLBG</a>: "I really like Hukum, his form is solid and I think he's got a massive chance.</p><p>"I think he's been perfectly prepared for the race, he's lightly-raced this year and this appears to be his target throughout."</p><p>3.50: <strong>DARKANIYA </strong>arrives in fine form after winning a big race in Germany last time.</p><p>She has plenty of staying power and has few miles on the clock so can improve.</p><p>Blue Rose Cen won the French Oaks the last time she had some decent ground and got a shocking ride at Goodwood from a jockey who didn’t know the course.<br>She didn’t stay 1m4f here last time but will be a threat over this trip.</p><p>Al Husn beat her in the Nassau Stakes but didn’t back that up at York on ground that was probably too quick. These conditions should suit better.</p><p>Rogue Millennium was a good second in the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown and is respected along with Jackie Oh who met traffic problems at The Curragh latest.</p><p>4.25: <strong>ART POWER</strong> was stranded on the wrong side of the track in the Flying Five at The Curragh last time.</p><p>He showed his true colours when winning the Sapphire Stakes at the Irish track in July and Tim Easterby’s hope looks a big price to make the frame at least.</p><p>Highfield Princess threw in a rare flop in Ireland last time and could have been feeling the effects of a relatively busy season.</p><p>There’s no doubt her best form would win this but there’s a slight question mark now.</p><p>Moss Tucker got the better of Highfield Princess in Ireland and will be a danger again.</p><p>Rogue Lightning has improved as the season’s gone on and he has valid place claims.</p><p>5.00: <strong>KINROSS </strong>can give Frankie a winner on his last Longchamp ride.</p><p>The Italian was on board when winning this 12 months ago and he looked as good as ever when scoring at York last time.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Sauterne is dropping back in trip after a battling Moulin win over a mile.</p><p>She’s at home over this trip too and looks the main danger.</p><h4 class=has-text-align-center id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here><a href=# aria-label="FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
