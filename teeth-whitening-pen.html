People started using these pens instead of toothpaste because they are more effective and ensure instant teeth whitening. However, you need to keep some points in mind to ensure that you get the most remarkable one in your hands.</span></p><h4><span>Safe materials</span></h4><p><span>When purchasing a teeth whitening pen, you need to ensure that it contains safe ingredients. The ingredients should not trigger any kinds of infection or allergies in your mouth.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You can look into a pen that contains hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. Carbamide peroxide whitens your teeth by removing surface stains, while hydrogen peroxide whitens teeth by destroying bacteria. The higher the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, the better is the product. Plus, carbamide peroxide can help get rid of the stains that have been haunting your teeth for years now.</span></p><h4><span>Even whitening tendencies</span></h4><p><span>Another important thing that you must pay special attention to while buying a teeth whitening pen is that it consistently covers all your teeth. The product that you have laid your eyes on should be able to cover all areas of your mouth and reach every corner without skipping a single one. In this way, all your teeth will be treated equally, and your smile will be full of bright teeth without a single yellow one.</span></p><h4><span>Simple to use</span></h4><p><span>None of us want to get into the trouble of dealing with mechanical or technical stuff. You do not wish for a teeth whitening pen full of complicated mechanisms. Your teeth whitening pen should be simple to use. There should be no need to seek help from a professional or a manual to make it work.</span></p><h4><span>Designed for your teeth</span></h4><p><span>Before choosing a teeth whitening pen, you must ultimately be familiar with your own teeth. You must know how sensitive they are and what products can trigger the pain. This familiarity can help you choose that one teeth whitening pen specifically designed for your teeth.</span></p><h3><span>What Are the Perks of Using Teeth-Whitening Pens?</span></h3><p><span>Teeth whitening pens are a blessing in disguise for all those people out there who want to save their precious time. These pens harbor several benefits, and here are a few of them.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span>Easy to use and carry</span></h4><p><span>The best part about whitening pens is that they can be taken anywhere. There is no need to worry about extra contents because they come in the form of a pen and are used with the help of a light. Teeth whitening pens are easy to travel with and will not spill. All you have to do is follow the instructions, apply for 30 seconds to one minute, and you will be good to go.</span></p><h4><span>Doesn't create any mess</span></h4><p><span>Unlike whitening toothpaste, teeth whitening pens do not create any mess. You won't see any gel stains here and there on the sink basin or your clothes. With these pens, everything is a clear and smooth ride. You won't have to spit on a bay or tray after using it, making it even more desirable. Plus, you can use them even when you are traveling. This makes them an ideal choice, especially for those who are always in a hurry.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span>Money savior</span></h4><p><span>You do not have to schedule time with your dentist or dental hygienist or purchase expensive chemicals or kits. This can help save a massive sum of your hard-earned money. Plus, there's a bonus that comes with it. You can operate it yourself anytime, and it takes the minimum amount of time to turn yellow teeth into pearly whites.</span></p><h3><span>How Does a Teeth Whitening Pen Work?</span></h3><p><span>Teeth whitening pens are oral care products that use hydrogen peroxide to whiten teeth. Most teeth whitening pens are designed to be used at home by the consumer. These pens are used effortlessly. The consumer has to press the pen against their teeth for a few seconds, and the light-emitting diodes inside the pen will produce light and heat.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The heat and light cause the peroxide in the pen to be released. This peroxide is the whitening agent, whitening the consumer's teeth. This whitening agent is contained within the pen and in a gel, which the consumer has to be careful not to swallow. This can be messy, but it is simple, and the consumer will see results.</span></p><h3><span>What Are the Types of Teeth Whitening Pens?</span></h3><p><span>Teeth whitening pens are more convenient to use than traditional trays. They are made of a custom bleaching gel sealed into a disposable pen applicator. There are two main types of teeth whitening pens available in the market; gels and power pens.&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>The gel pens use the same bleaching gel that the trays use. All you need to do is use this pen to release the gel on your teeth for some time, and everything becomes cool.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>The power pens use a special bleaching gel that needs to be charged to deliver the bleaching gel more efficiently. This unique gel is more efficient than the traditional bleaching gels. The power pen is also much more convenient to use than the tray and the accelerator. The accelerator causes dry mouth, and the tray requires you to wear the trays overnight. The power pen doesn't require any exceptional prep work; tooth sensitivity can be experienced, but it is much less than the tray. It is also much less messy to apply than the trays.</span></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwr86spJ6smZjAcMDEnquhZaedtrWxzaKloGWgmrtw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fteeth-whitening-pen.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fteeth-whitening-pen.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fteeth-whitening-pen.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fteeth-whitening-pen.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fteeth-whitening-pen.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fteeth-whitening-pen.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./xsdqzl-ivt5rjzrduwckl84s2gl35g3b.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./xsdqzl-ivt5rjzrduwckl84s2gl35g3b.html>Watch National Women's Soccer League Season 2023 Episode 130: Houston Dash vs. Washington Spirit</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./married-ring-wedding-band-indent-jason-of-beverly-hills.html>New Married Ring Leaves Branded Indent On Finger If Removed Cool Or Crazy?
