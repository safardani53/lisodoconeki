Here, Tim accomplished this fast for 35 days, and yes, he went by without food and just water. Straight starvation, to be exact!&nbsp;</p><p>As per Tim, distilled water fasting relieves the body from digesting food, improving health, and keeping away diseases. But, while many were taking the lead, some did stand against it.&nbsp;</p><p>As some said, this move was indeed irresponsible as an influencer and athlete.

Well, Tim became a vegan back in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>“Before becoming a vegan, my joints hurt. After becoming vegan… my recovery time’s non-existent. Little or no muscle soreness. I can run forever.” -Tim Shieff.</p><p>Later, in 2018, Tim admitted that he ate eggs and fish. Also, he stated that being back as a non-vegan made him better, and eating salmon gave him wet dreams.&nbsp;</p><p>“My depression lifted, joints feeling a lot better, energy back in my body. I do feel like the next stage for me is to kill an animal myself. I’ve got to really face this.” -Tim Shieff.</p><p>Well, these statements dropped Tim out of ETHCS.&nbsp;</p><p>“For a long time, Tim had been an inspirational example for veganism, as well as a good friend who has inspired us all, but this lifestyle change was something none of us could get on board with. When Tim told us of his intention to return to eating animal products, we were obviously very shocked and upset.” -ETHCS.</p><h3>Tim Shieff Net Worth | Charity and Help</h3><p>Back in 2014, Tim Shieff starred in a birthday suit photoshoot to raise funds for Jamie Oliver Foundation.
