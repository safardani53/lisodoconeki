Jacobs. He recommends using an eye serum to up the ante on hydration and give the delicate under-eye skin a boost of nourishment while also targeting concerns.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp

pre-existing concerns, Dr. Jacobs says there’s no time like the present and that anyone can start incorporating an eye serum into the skincare routine at any time — even if you don’t yet experience fine lines, puffiness, or need to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>correct dark spots</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp

delicate areas, such as the area under the eyes,” he tells PEOPLE. “Adding an eye serum to your routine in your early 20s could help retain the moisture in that area.”&nbsp;</p><p

data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>peptides for targeting wrinkles</a>, pink silk tree for brightening the look of dark circles, and sea algae for hydrating and toning the skin, plus probiotic extract for de-puffing the complexion, this formula has a rich, creamy consistency that provides a burst of hydration that smooths and nourishes the under-eye area.&nbsp;In addition to its formula, the Tula eye serum comes with a cooling applicator that makes it easier to massage the creamy concoction into the skin while effectively eliminating puffy under-eye

As its name suggests, this formula is created with ginseng extract and retinal, which work together to target the fine lines and wrinkles caused by the effects of aging, including a loss of elasticity caused by decreased hyaluronic acid and collagen production.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During our tests, we found that the eye serum has a super lightweight feel that is cooling and refreshing to the touch — not to mention it’s compatible with most skin types. We also noted how well the formula layers with other skincare and makeup formulas without lifting or clumping. Since it is so lightweight, the formula is also fast-absorbing, too. This not only ensures that the complexion absorbs all of its goodness but also means a little goes a long way, so you can really get the most out of this $17 eye serum.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Ginseng extract, retinal | <strong>Good For: </strong>Targeting fine lines and wrinkles around the eye</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-mature-skin-strivectin-peptight-360-tightening-eye-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Mature Skin</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>StriVectin Tightening Eye Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/PNm44cT5_EDAvGptHk3pw0Q8QK4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/strivectin-peptight-360-tightening-eye-serum-eaa61ea09c044699ac800d0f52e0ec98.jpg"><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Texture</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>This formula worked fast to brighten our skin while reducing puffiness under the eyes.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has a cooling applicator that massages the under-eye skin while applying the formula.</p></li><li readability=0><p>With regular use, the formula (and applicator) helped reduce fine lines.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>At $72, it’s a relatively expensive formula compared to others we tested — however, you can sometimes find it on sale.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested 27 different formulas to see which would be the best option for mature skin, ultimately landing on the StriVectin Peptight 360 Tightening Eye Serum after being especially impressed with the results. <strong>After using this formula regularly over the course of a few weeks, our tester found that the fine lines and wrinkles around her eyes appeared less noticeable and her skin also felt brighter, firmer, and less puffy.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Enriched with a triple peptide blend along with caffeine and Kakadu plum extract, the eye serum works well at tightening and firming loose skin under the eyes while also brightening dark circles.

During testing, we found that we needed more time to truly see some of its results as we didn’t experience its brightening claims. But thanks to its deeply nourishing and hydrating formula — which features hyaluronic acid for attracting moisture to the skin — we think it’s worth mentioning because it provides instant hydration and helps soften and soothe the skin under the eyes.&nbsp;</li><li><strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Eye Serum</a>: </strong>We also tested the Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Eye Serum and were highly impressed by its rich formula featuring fast and slow-release retinols to gently target puffiness around the eyes while also blurring fine lines and wrinkles.

As its name suggests, this formula features moisture-attracting hyaluronic acid and caffeine to soften, soothe, and nourish the under-eye area while also de-puffing. Since the serum features a massage applicator, it works fast at de-puffing the eyes, and for the price, we thought it was worth noting. That being said, the eye serum worked best at delivering short-term results vs. long-term benefits, so it didn’t quite make our best of list.&nbsp;</li></ul><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-when-buying-eye-serums></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider When Buying Eye Serums</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ingredients&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When shopping for effective eye serums, Dr. Jacobs says to first consider the ingredients and look for formulas that support elasticity, collagen, and hydration, such as <strong>vitamin C, retinol, and hyaluronic acid.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Vitamin C and retinol aid in collagen production and skin elasticity, supporting a more radiant under-eye appearance,” he explains. “Hyaluronic acid moisturizes the area without being too thick,” he adds, noting that hydration is important because it can give a more refreshed appearance while softening, soothing, and supporting suppleness.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the best eye <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>serums with vitamin C</a>, consider the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Dermalogica Biolumin-C Vitamin C Eye Serum</a> and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Perricone MD Brightening Eye Serum</a> which both feature formulas with vitamin C for its brightening benefits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you wish to up the ante and want to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>target fine lines and wrinkles with retinol</a>, we recommend the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Drunk Elephant A-Shaba Complex Retinol Eye Serum with Caffeine + Copper Peptides</a>.

From there, we narrowed down our selections to 27 eye serums to conduct real-world and lab testing over the course of several weeks. We rated each product against the following attributes:</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Consistency: </strong>We considered the formula's texture and consistency, noting how thick or runny it was and whether it had a greasy or oily feel upon application. We also tested if it can double as a primer based on how well it works as a base for makeup and other skincare products.</li><li><strong>Absorption: </strong>To test this, we applied each formula and waited ten minutes and then recorded how long it took for the formula to fully absorb, and noted whether or not it felt like the formula sat atop the skin without sinking in. We also took into consideration how much product we needed to feel like the area was adequately covered — and whether or not that matched up to the recommended usage amount on the package instructions.</li><li><strong>Skin Texture:</strong> After the testing period was complete, we observed how our under-eye area improved, if at all, and noted any specific changes. We detailed whether we saw improvements in dark circles, puffiness, and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, as well as noting whether our skin looked or felt tighter, firmer, softer, and/or smoother compared to the beginning of testing.</li><li><strong>Feel: </strong>Here, we identified any products that may be less than ideal for those with sensitive skin, noting any burning or tingling sensations we felt during initial application. This rating was also based on whether the product felt sticky or tacky on the skin, if it offered any cooling effect, if it felt comfortable to wear, and if it felt gentle enough for everyday use.</li><li><strong>Overall Results:</strong> To discern the overall results, we noted which products were more fast-acting or longer-lasting than others. In the PEOPLE Tested lab, we also measured our under-eye area with a moisture reader to note the difference in our moisture levels before and after applying each eye cream. This rating also covers the scent and whether or not the tester felt the scent (if any) was overpowering or pleasant.</li></ul><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-f0573ae7-6d1e-4248-ac62-bc5c746a0277></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=47.932721712538><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.88328075709779><p><span class=accordion__title>Which eye serum is the best?</span></p><p>Our top pick for the best eye serum overall is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tula Eye Renewal Serum</a>.
