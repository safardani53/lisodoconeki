Some couples simply go their separate ways, figure out that they weren’t meant to be, or something far more dramatic takes place to cause two stars to drift apart. <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jennifer Lopez</a>&nbsp;</strong>once had a very short-lived marriage, but she’s proof that true love can come well beyond a failed marriage. She got married for a fourth time to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a>&nbsp;and the famous couple is preparing to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>host a major party</a> to celebrate. We thought it would&nbsp;be a good idea to take a look back at some of the shortest celebrity marriages of all time.</p><h2>Nicolas Cage & Erika Koike</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hollywood-shortest-Marriages-Of-All-Time-Nicolas-Cage-Erika-Koike-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Nicolas Cage&nbsp;and<strong> Erika Koike</strong> really redefined the term “quickie marriage” with their whirlwind relationship. The National Treasure icon <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filed for an annulment</a> from his fourth wife just four days after they tied the knot in Las Vegas and he was serious about the split. The actor, then 55, and makeup artist, then 34, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>applied for a marriage license</a> in Nevada on March 23, 2019, but when Nic came to pick it up on the 27th, he asked for the annulment papers instead! Nic&nbsp;claimed that he “lacked understanding” of what was going on when he said “I do” to his girlfriend because he had been “drinking to the point of intoxication,” according to documents obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Blast</a>. He also accused his then-girlfriend of not disclosing “the full nature and extent of her relationship with another person,” and that she didn’t disclose her alleged “criminal history.” Thus, Nicolas alleged that this marriage would have been a “fraud.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Nic did what he did,” Erika said when <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>speaking</a> for the first time on the doomed marriage. “We’re not going to reconcile or get back together. Nic could have come to me and talked to me, not publicly humiliate me. I’m hurt and mistreated, it’s unfair, but the case is sealed, and my lawyer won’t let me speak until we are all done.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Nicholas and Erika were <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>granted a legal divorce</a> two months later on May 31.&nbsp;The documents, which were obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>, showed that Nic failed to score the annulment and “settled for a divorce the old fashioned way.”</p><h2>Jennifer Lopez & Cris Judd</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hollywood-shortest-Marriages-Of-All-Time-jennifer-lopez-cris-judd-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Long before her engagement to&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong></a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>came to an end</a> in April 2021,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a>‘s union with&nbsp;<strong>Cris Judd</strong> ended quite quickly. Cris was J.Lo’s backup dancer before they decided to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>take their professional relationship to a new level</a>. After a whirlwind romance, the two tied the knot in September 2001. Unfortunately, the couple divorced less than a year after saying “I do.” The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>former couple’s divorce was finalized</a> in June 2002.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Cris’s father gave an interview in 2002 where he pinned the blame for the breakup on <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a>, who J.Lo started dating once they met on the set of Gigli. Cris himself was willing to let bygones be bygones. He talked about his failed relationship with J.Lo on a&nbsp;2013 episode of Oprah: Where Are They Now?, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HuffPost</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“During the time when we were separated, and we were going through [the] divorce, I was getting a lot of calls to interview, and naturally, everyone wants to know the dirt about your marriage and what went wrong,” Cris said. “And I never wanted to do that because that’s no one’s business.”</p><h2>Kim Kardashian & Kris Humphries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hollywood-shortest-Marriages-Of-All-Time-kris-humphries-kim-kardashian-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Another marriage that probably comes to mind is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> and NBA star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kris Humphries</strong></a>‘ <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>short-lived union</a>. Kim and Kris, of course, only <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lasted 72 days</a>. The couple dated for seven months, got engaged, and had a fairytale wedding in August 2011, just three months later, that aired on <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a>. But by October 2011, Kim filed for divorce. The former couple’s divorce was finalized in June 2013, just ahead of the birth of Kim’s first child with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Kim spoke candidly about when she knew the marriage wasn’t going to work during her May 2017 appearance on Watch What Happens Live!&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>.&nbsp;“At the time I didn’t even — I just thought, ‘Holy sh*t, I’m 30 years old. I better get this together; I better get married.’ I think a lot of girls do go through that — where they freak out and think they’re getting old and they have to figure it out,” she said. “But I knew, like, [by the] honeymoon it wasn’t going to work out.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Kris <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>addressed the divorce</a> in a lengthy piece for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Player’s Tribune</a>&nbsp;published in March 2019. I should have known what I was getting into,” he admitted. “I was definitely naive about how much my life was going to change. But the one thing that really bothers me is whenever people say my marriage was fake. There’s definitely a lot about that world that is not entirely real. But our <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>actual relationship</a> was 100% real. When it was clear that it wasn’t working…what can I say? It sucked. It’s never easy to go through the embarrassment of something like that — with your friends, with your family….but when it plays out so publicly, in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>front of the world</a>, it’s a whole other level. It was brutal.”</p><h2>Britney Spears & Jason Allen Alexander</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hollywood-shortest-Marriages-Of-All-Time-Britney-Spears-Jason-Allen-Alexander-embed4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a> has a few celebs on this list beat by miles. Her 2004 marriage to childhood friend <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jason Allen Alexander</strong></a> lasted an astounding 55 hours. The pair was drunk in Las Vegas and decided to get hitched at a drive-thru chapel. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>It was annulled</a> following a petition to the court that stated Britney “lacked understanding of her actions.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Jason <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>looked back on the brief marriage</a> in a July 2021 episode of Toxic: The Britney Spears Story&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>podcast</a>. “We felt like this was a way that would bond us together, regardless of how far we are separated. We’re married. You can’t not let us reunite,” he said, before saying what allegedly happened after the Vegas wedding. “We left, consummated the marriage in the limousine on the way back to the hotel and then when we got back to the hotel — ‘Hey, guess what? We’re married!’ and everybody freaked out and no one was happy. And I was like, ‘Oh, this is about to get interesting.’ ”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>In June 2022, Jason tried crashing Britney’s wedding to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sam Asghari</strong></a>&nbsp;at her home in California. He livestreamed himself going to Britney’s house and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>asking about the wedding.</a> “Britney Spears invited me here. She’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>my first wife</a>—my only wife. I’m her first husband. I’m here to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>crash the wedding,”</a> he said in a video he recorded. He was subsequently arrested outside of the singer’s home. Jason was convicted of aggravated trespass and battery and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was sentenced to 128 days</a>&nbsp;at Ventura County Jail. Britney was also granted a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three-year restraining order</a>&nbsp;against Jason.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9KhpquslajBbq%2FEpZybqpmpxm65wKupopmXmsBusMivpqublah6qbvLpbCwp5%2BZenSBlWtua2pf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshortest-celebrity-marriages-divorces-hollywood-3562722.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fshortest-celebrity-marriages-divorces-hollywood-3562722.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fshortest-celebrity-marriages-divorces-hollywood-3562722.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fshortest-celebrity-marriages-divorces-hollywood-3562722.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshortest-celebrity-marriages-divorces-hollywood-3562722.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshortest-celebrity-marriages-divorces-hollywood-3562722.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tom-halliwell-england-world-cup-honour-wheelchair.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tom-halliwell-england-world-cup-honour-wheelchair.html>Tom Halliwell says impact of England's World Cup win is more than his OBE</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./camila-cabellos-references-to-shawn-mendes-split-on-familia.html>Camila Cabello's References to Shawn Mendes Split on 'Familia'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./camila-cabellos-references-to-shawn-mendes-split-on-familia.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
