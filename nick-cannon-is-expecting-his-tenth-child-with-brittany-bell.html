<time>09 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Nick Cannon</strong> is about to have his 10th kid. The television star came to Instagram to share a video with her soon-to-be mother, Brittany Bell. The couple already has two children, Golden Sagon, five, and Powerful Queen, one. Netizens swarmed the internet with amusing memes when Cannon revealed that he is expecting another kid. Cannon has “more kids than Zeus,” according to one Twitter user, an opinion shared by many others. Nick Cannon captioned an Instagram image, “Time Stopped and This Happened…” and included a video of him and Bell in a maternity shoot. In the video, the 34-year-old can be seen wearing a variety of clothing while displaying her baby bulge.</p><p>In one scene, Bell is seen laying on the floor, her hands concealing her breasts as a large sheet is wrapped over her lower half. Meanwhile, Cannon, 41, loomed over her. Cannon was seen in another image blissfully holding Bell’s baby bump. It is uncertain when Bell is anticipated to give birth. It’s worth mentioning that this isn’t the Wild N’ Out host’s first kid. He is also expecting his ninth kid with Abby De La Rosa.</p><h2>Netizens react to Nick Cannon becoming a parent for the tenth time.</h2><p>Internet fans who discovered Nick Cannon had another child seemed to be primarily dissatisfied by the Drumline star’s news. Multiple of them commented on how bizarre it was that there were several women who were moms to his children.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nick-Cannon-1.jpg alt="Nick Cannon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>As individuals expressed their comments about Cannon and the number of children he had, jokes about his family situation quickly swept over the internet. The Love Don’t Cost a Thing celebrity has eight additional children. With ex-wife Mariah Carey, he has 11-year-old twin daughters Monroe and Moroccan. With Abby De La Rosa, he has 13-month-old twins Zion and Zillion, as well as a newborn boy called Legendary Love with Bre Tiesi.</p><p>Cannon also had a son called Zen, who died in December 2021 at the age of five months. Zen, whom Cannon shared with singer-songwriter Alyssa Scott, died as a result of brain cancer.&nbsp;As previously stated, Cannon and Bell have two children, Golden Sagon and Powerful Queen.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>me opening twitter every other week to see that nick cannon has another child on the way <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Md1NC6U47a</a></p><p>— iris.⁷⋆🃏 (@heywcrds) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 24, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Nick Cannon FaceTiming his Kids <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/SO41ugv0SK</a></p><p>— Harold (@_IamHarold) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 24, 2022</a></p><h2>Nick Cannon says that he will have more children.</h2><p>In June, the actor announced on the Lip Service podcast that he would want to have more children. The presenter asked Nick Cannon about rumors that he had “three kids on the way” this year, to which Cannon joked:</p><p>“What count are you at when you say “on the way…”?” Let’s put it this way… “The stork has arrived.”</p><p>In 2021, Cannon will have three children. When asked whether he intends to shatter the record, the San Diego native said, “I don’t know.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nick-Cannon-2.jpg alt="Nick Cannon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“If you thought there were a lot of kids last year…”</p><p>Cannon also told E! News about his excitement at having children. During the interview, he stated:</p><p>“I’m not wanting to totally populate the Earth, but I am looking forward to caring for and loving all of the children that I now have.” I’m not sure I would have intended it this way, but it’s one of those things that comes with having children.”</p><p>Cannon also said that he has “gone through so much” and that his children provide him with “calm” and “solace.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGilopubYrCius2opWaho2KyubzEnKuippditaq%2FjK2cp6yYYrCptcudZLChpJ16o77Irauapqlir6a4y2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnick-cannon-is-expecting-his-tenth-child-with-brittany-bell.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnick-cannon-is-expecting-his-tenth-child-with-brittany-bell.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnick-cannon-is-expecting-his-tenth-child-with-brittany-bell.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnick-cannon-is-expecting-his-tenth-child-with-brittany-bell.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnick-cannon-is-expecting-his-tenth-child-with-brittany-bell.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnick-cannon-is-expecting-his-tenth-child-with-brittany-bell.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./xavier-alexander-wahlberg.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./xavier-alexander-wahlberg.html>Who is Donnie Wahlberg's Son Xavier Alexander Wahlberg?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./natasha-liu-bordizzo.html>Natasha Liu Bordizzo Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./natasha-liu-bordizzo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
