Hence, Evans was exposed to drugs, alcohol abuse, and depression from a tender age.</p><p>Furthermore, her family was broke; they didn’t have a home to provide due to the legal problems; thus, they were sharing tents to live in.</p><p>Despite the shivering situation, Evans had thrived; she went to school and finished her beginning years at Fort William Wood. Today, she has a bachelor’s degree from Indian River State College.</p><p>When Evans opens up today, she explains how she knew drugs and alcohol weren’t for her. She knew its smell, knew what it does, and the best, she knows she doesn’t want it.</p><p>“So, I used my platform to show the world regardless if you’re the addict, or the baby that is stuck in it, or living in that type of life, even down to simple depression, where you feel like life is kicking you and beating you, it’s a terrible, terrible thing to be in. I know exactly what it feels like. Here I am, just taking it one day at a time-raising a strong, confident, and proud little lady (her daughter Summer), who doesn’t have to worry that her mom can’t wake up.”<br>-Lacey Evans</p><h2>Lacey Evans | Military Career</h2><p>Nearing the accomplishment of her teenage days, Evans started serving in the Marines at the age of 19.</p><p>She is also a veteran of the United States Marine Corps, where she served as a military officer for five straight years.</p><p>Infact, Evans’ passion for law enforcement came back when she met police officers at their doorstep.</p><p>Furthermore, she needed to be someone who people can rely on.</p><p>According to Lacey, she speaks about how working in the Special Reaction Team gave her the way “to see the positive in the motivation, in what you’re capable of mentally, physically and emotionally.”</p><p>During her tenure at Beaufort Air Station in South Carolina, she tried to stuff as log runs to pool swims.</p><p>While still in training, she had an audition for WWE, which came through a boot camp, giving her another rise.</p><h3>Military Makeover</h3><p>Altogether, Evans is a military mother who had appeared in the Lifetime network TV show “Military Makeover.”</p><p>As per Evans, fame is not something she had ever looked into; however, she runs for it if seeing her someone gets motivated.</p><p>Furthermore, talking about the show is a program to help active-duty and retired service members renovate their homes.</p><p>This show was hosted by the former Marine and talk show host, Montel Williams.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Military-Makeover.jpg><h2>Lacey Evans | Professional Wrestling Career</h2><p>At first, through her staff sergeant’s backyard wrestling, Evans got into the independent circuit.</p><p>At first, she was there to observe; however, she grew in love with that sport.

They require loads of acting lessons, followed by catchy names to gain people’s attention.</p><p>To illustrate, they have to build a lifelike charter of themselves either as a hero, villain or as a face, heel.</p><p>Hence, the same thing was for Lacey Evans. She had this name, representing a classy lady with the taste in 1940s-style as she adorns herself with dresses and outfits.</p><p>Overall, her look is a Southern Belle character who mocks people for the lack of classiness and etiquette.</p><p>“I love femininity. I love being a mother and wife. It is that I just never had the opportunity to be the sexy, sassy woman I’ve always been. While the character was created after the fact, I’ve always been that way. The gimmick is a part of you; if it’s not, it won’t ever work.”<br>-Lacey Evans</p><p>With her words, maybe you can understand better the gist of the character.</p><p>Simultaneously, for her entrance, Evans has a personalized themed song and from that very appearance of her character, what Evans wants to prove is feminine with toughness.</p><p>According to her, the fame she gets is the only way she can motivate girls out there.
