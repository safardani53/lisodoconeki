as well as itchy rashes under her breasts.</p><p>She said she struggled to sleep on her back as it felt like they were "choking" her.</p><p>Annie finally decided to have surgery and is celebrating her transformation.</p><p>"It was shocking – I lived with those breasts my entire life and they were massive.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health News</h2></p><p>"It's a total mind f**k to have your body change overnight and, in my eyes, I don't see myself as I am.</p><p>"I had my first consult with a plastic surgeon in 2012 and at that time, very few surgeons were doing plus-size surgeries.</p><p>"They wanted me to lose 50lbs and maintain that loss for over a year before surgery and I lost, but gained [this weight] over and over again," Annie said.</p><p>She added that previously, doctors had told her she had <a href=#>polycystic ovary syndrome</a> (PCOS).</p><p>This can cause obesity and make it hard to maintain weight loss.</p><p>But she eventually managed to find a surgeon who didn't ask about her weight and said they would do her surgery despite her body mass index (BMI).</p><p>It's unbelievable the pain we cause ourselves, all while pretending to be OK</p><span class=quote-credit>Annie Anderson</span><p>Many surgeons will refuse to operate on someone whose BMI is over a certain rate - as this can be dangerous.</p><p>But Annie said her doctor looked at all the risk factors in order to make a decision.</p><p>She said that before the surgery, buying swimsuits and dresses had always been difficult.</p><p>"I could never wear the cute sundresses I wanted to because I could never go without a bra and a strapless one didn't hold me up enough.</p><p>"Practically every shirt I owned had a stain on the chest [as well] because it was like eating with a shelf in the way.</p><p>"Most exercise was painful and embarrassing and I've never been able to jog or run.</p><p>"It's unbelievable the pain we cause ourselves, all while pretending to be OK," Annie said.</p><h2>BOOKED IN</h2><p>Annie booked the procedure in March 2022 and was able to get it for free as her health insurance covered the surgery.</p><p>But she highlighted that her recovery hasn't been easy, with delays.</p><p>She said: "They say it will be up to a year before I will see and feel the final results – but I've been cleared to wear underwire bras once again and can go without if I'd like.</p><p>"I still have swelling and major bloating by the end of the day, but my back, neck and shoulder pain are gone.</p><p>"I'm already way more consistently active than I was before the surgery and I walk or swim most days."</p><p>She has recently been measured for a new bra and is a 42C - with the doctor claiming he removed 2.5lbs from each breast.</p><h2>GOODBYE OLD FRIENDS</h2><p>In order to let go of her old boobs, she had a goodbye party.</p><p>Annie said they had gotten her lots of attention over the years.</p><p>Her friends ordered a plaster cast kit and they all casted their own breasts to make her feel more comfortable.</p><p>Sharing the before and after of her transformation, Annie decided to upload a video of her dancing with the cast – which has racked up three million views and 72,000 likes.</p><p>Annie now says she wishes she'd had the procedure sooner as she spent so many years hating her body.</p><p>"[Now], I get so many compliments on my appearance and most people are extremely supportive.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"The whole body positivity movement helps with acceptance and I'm still a plus-size woman, I'm just shaped differently and a whole lot more comfortable in my own skin.</p><p>"I'm learning to love myself, finally," she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000752688667.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000752688495.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIJ6g5hraW9nkqS8o7%2BMrKZmmpmceqS0zqSgp59dorJusM6nq2aqlZi8qLrIrJxmpamosq2yjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fboobs-so-big-choking-me-dont-recognise-myself.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fboobs-so-big-choking-me-dont-recognise-myself.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fboobs-so-big-choking-me-dont-recognise-myself.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fboobs-so-big-choking-me-dont-recognise-myself.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fboobs-so-big-choking-me-dont-recognise-myself.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fboobs-so-big-choking-me-dont-recognise-myself.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./myron-rolle.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./myron-rolle.html>Myron Rolle</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./katy-perry-uk-tour-2024-album.html>Music megastar finalises new album and gears up for UK tour after break of six years</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./katy-perry-uk-tour-2024-album.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
