Having signed with Next Management around six years ago, Brandon has walked for leading fashion houses like Dolce & Gabbana and Philipp Plein. Brandon got one of his first acting breaks in 2018, with a role in Ian Samuels's Sierra Burgess Is a Loser. So, what does Brandon do for a living?&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what does Brandon Thomas Lee do for a living?</h2><p>At first, Brandon likely had a few precautions about following in the footsteps of his parents, '90s it-couple Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson. As he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a>, he and his brother, Dylan Jagger Lee, learned about how paparazzi operate at a young age.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I remember one day asking my mom, 'Hey, why does everybody take photos of us?' And she said, 'Oh, they do that to everybody.'" Brandon told Interview. "Then, I remember being with one of my friends' families when I was, like, 10, and we walked into dinner somewhere, and I said to them, 'Hey, why does nobody take photos of you guys?'"&nbsp;</p><p>Brandon didn't plan on becoming a model, and it's only when he had a brief encounter with a modeling scout while accompanying his mom, Pamela, to a meeting, that he began to change his mind. As he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grazia</a>, he signed with Next Management after accidentally bumping into an agent on his way back from the bathroom.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"'Are you a model? Why are you here? Does anyone represent you?' she asked," Brandon recalled. "I replied, 'No. I'm not a model. At all. And I don't want to be.' I wasn't really into working in the entertainment industry — well not modeling per se — and I never really thought of myself as having the model look. I always thought I wanted to be in film and models had to be super tall and good-looking."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Brandon's acting career kicked off a few years later. In 2018, he got cast in Tales, a hit TV show with Bella Thorne, David Dunston, and Alzie Williams. He played Duke Orsino in an episode of Acting for a Cause, titled "Twelfth Night," and Billy Ryan in<strong> </strong>Blackjack: The Jackie Ryan Story.<strong> </strong>Brandon's latest projects include Cosmic Sin,<strong> </strong>a movie directed by Edward Drake, and Zero Road, a drama by Chance Sanchez.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although Brandon has already amassed a more than impressive list of acting credits, he only started to garner more media attention once he agreed to <a href=#>star on The Hills: New Beginnings</a>, the reboot of the epoch-making reality TV show that first premiered on MTV in 2006. Still, as he let slip in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a>, he doesn't know <a href=#>who Lauren Conrad is</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, how much is Brandon Thomas Lee's net worth?</h2><p>Brandon is yet to disclose how much his assets come to. According to outlets like Nicki Swift, he might have as much as $1 million. Tommy Lee's net worth is estimated to be somewhere between $70–$75 million, while Pamela Anderson reportedly has around $12–20 million. Regardless, Brandon maintains that he and his brother haven't asked for money from their parents since they were in high school.&nbsp;</p><p>"There are a lot of misconceptions about the way we were raised — that we're spoiled, or that we were given everything," Brandon told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a>. "But our friends can back this up: Dylan and I haven't taken a dollar from our parents since we were in high school."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXZe%2ForrDqKVmrJikuqK%2FjKWcnmWUpHqnu9FmmGakmau2r7M%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-does-brandon-thomas-lee-do-for-a-living.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-does-brandon-thomas-lee-do-for-a-living.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-does-brandon-thomas-lee-do-for-a-living.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-does-brandon-thomas-lee-do-for-a-living.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-does-brandon-thomas-lee-do-for-a-living.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-brandon-thomas-lee-do-for-a-living.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-melvin-ingram-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-melvin-ingram-dating.html>Who is Melvin Ingram Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gretchen-wilson-arrested-mugshot-sleeping.html>Looks Asleep In Mugshot Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gretchen-wilson-arrested-mugshot-sleeping.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
