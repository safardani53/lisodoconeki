We took it a different way. This music was composed by us. We did our thing, you know, we hustled and f***ed ourselves to get here. And, you know, it‚Äôs like, you know, ‚ÄòEat the wealthy,‚Äô and, man, we‚Äôre not stopping.‚Äù</p><h2>Everything we know about Jay-Z‚Äôs billion-dollar wealth</h2><p>Jay Z is now one of the most prominent hip-hop musicians in the business, having sold over 140 million albums and winning 24 Grammy Awards.&nbsp;His considerable earnings as a singer, songwriter, record producer, entrepreneur, rapper, actor, film producer, and television producer have contributed to his $1.3 billion net worth.&nbsp;Jay-Z is a co-founder of the apparel label Rocawear, which he started alongside Damon Dash in 1999.
