Easy-E, born Eric Lynn Wright on September 7, 1964, in Compton, California, Los Angeles parents Kathie Wright and Richard Wright. He is well known for co-founding the N.W.A group and label.</p><p>N.W.A is a Compton, California-based American hip-hop group. The group had seven members. The group was created by Arabian Prince, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, J Yella, and MC Ren. However, Eazy-E died on March 26, 1995, at the age of 31. Many books and video biographies on his life events were written after his death. He is also recognized as the “Godfather of Gangsta Rap.”</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Eric Wright</strong>, the late American rapper, songwriter, record producer, and entrepreneur, had an estimated net worth of $8 million. He was valued at $50 million at the height of his career. His music career greatly increased his net worth.<br>He composed a large number of songs, which helped him become a highly popular performer. E launched his album in 1988, and it sold over 2.5 million copies in the United States. It earned him more than $7 million back then. His son, Lil Eazy E, declared that if his father were still alive, he would be a multibillionaire. Eazy used to make $250,000 from drug selling in addition to singing.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Eazy-E.jpg alt=Eazy-E width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Lifestyle</h2><p>E was born in Compton, Los Angeles County, California, USA. E’s father was a postal worker, and his mother was a school administrator while he was growing up. Similarly, due to the dangerous area, he supported himself mostly via the sale of narcotics and introduced his cousin to the illegal vocation.</p><p>Because of his small size, he was dubbed “thug.” However, E’s cousin was shot and died when he was 22 years old. That’s when he decided to stop supplying drugs and start hip-hop. Finally, in the mid-1980s, he began recording songs in the garage of his parents.&nbsp;That’s when he began work on his smash hit “Ruthless Records.” One month after being diagnosed with AIDS, Eazy-E died on March 26, 1995, from AIDS-related pneumonia. Following her father’s death, Ebie initiated a crowd-funding drive to create Ruthless Scandal: No More Lies, a documentary about her father’s death. E has eleven children from eight different women.</p><h2>Charity</h2><p>The late artists’ family established the Eazy Street Kids Charity. Its goal is to collect money for poor children and the local educational system. Similarly, his generosity aided charities such as Athletes and Entertainers For Kids, United Colors of Benetton, and the Make-a-Wish Foundation. Similarly, he advocated for problems such as health, education, HIV/AIDS, hunger, and poverty.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Eazy-E-1.jpg alt=Eazy-E width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Eric was engaged in drugs prior to beginning his career as a rapper. He used to make a lot of money from it. After his relative died, he resolved to change his life and start again as a rapper.&nbsp;He started his hip-hop career with N.W.A. Dr. Dre, on the other hand, spent a lot of time encouraging him to become a rapper.&nbsp;E’s song Efil4zaggin reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts in 1990.&nbsp;Every single bandmate agreed that E was extremely ahead of his time since he was able to pay studio fees on his own.</p><p>E also became the anchor of a Los Angeles radio music program on KKBT-FM in 1994.&nbsp;Furthermore, in 1992, he published his first solo EP, 5150 Home 4 tha Sick, and the following year, another EP.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the great rapper died in 1995 from Pneumonia and HIV AIDS.&nbsp;He was working on his record at the time of his death in 1995.&nbsp;Following his death, his wife Tomica Woods was able to preserve the “Ruthless Record.”&nbsp;E was laid to rest at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California.&nbsp;More than 3,000 people attended his funeral.&nbsp;After ten months, Eric Lynn Wright’s last album, Str8 off tha Streetz of Muthaphukkin Compton, was released.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGicmrKpYrJuusStZLCnoqm1brTOsGSroZOderit0mafnmWcnrOmv9Oyo55lkaOxbq%2FAq5yeql2dtqi0y6KeoayjZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feazy-e-net-worth-how-rich-was-he-lifestyle-and-career-highlights.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feazy-e-net-worth-how-rich-was-he-lifestyle-and-career-highlights.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feazy-e-net-worth-how-rich-was-he-lifestyle-and-career-highlights.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feazy-e-net-worth-how-rich-was-he-lifestyle-and-career-highlights.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feazy-e-net-worth-how-rich-was-he-lifestyle-and-career-highlights.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feazy-e-net-worth-how-rich-was-he-lifestyle-and-career-highlights.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gus-bilirakis.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gus-bilirakis.html>Gus Bilirakis</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-cocktail-attire-wedding.html>What is cocktail attire for a wedding?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-is-cocktail-attire-wedding.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
