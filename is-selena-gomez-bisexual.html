While there have always been rumors that Selena Gomez is bisexual, it’s been tough to confirm.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When it was announced that Selena was cast as Silvia Vásquez-Lavado, there was some definite outrage over casting a seemingly heterosexual actor who also is not Peruvian (although she is Latinx), but fans came to her defense, insisting that Selena Gomez is, in fact, bisexual. So what’s the truth? Is Selena bisexual, or is it simply something we’ve willed into existence?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Selena Gomez hasn’t really confirmed she is bisexual.</h2><p>Selena has talked a lot about mental health and a little about sexuality, but hasn’t flat out said “I am bisexual,” so anything we may surmise is simply speculation. It’s not Selena’s responsibility to tell the world who she loves, but being cast in an LGBTQ+ role has definitely catapulted her back into the limelight, and subsequently, fan speculation.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>why r ppl mad? selena has always been a bisexual queen</p>— r* (@loveIangauge) <a href=#>November 11, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>In October 2015, when asked if she questions her sexuality in a Q&A with PrideSource, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena</a> shared, “I think everybody does, no matter who they are. I do, yeah, of course. Absolutely. I think it’s healthy to gain a perspective on who you are deep down, question yourself and challenge yourself; it’s important to do that.” Selena’s open about questioning who she is, which is important and an example for all of us!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There have been several rumors that Selena is bisexual.</h2><p>While we don’t support outing anyone, several gossip columns and online publications have shared rumors of Selena dating and hooking up with other women. One of the most memorable instances is when there were rumors that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez dated Cara Delevigne</a> after the two were seen on vacation together in the French Riviera and dancing together in the club. Cara is openly bisexual, so of course rumors of a romance would circulate, and Selena said she actually “loved it!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In addition, a gossip column, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ExposingMSG</a>, did a deep dive into trying to confirm that Selena dated her backup dancer, Charity Baroni. There seems to be some clout to their speculation, however. Starting in 2013, Selena posted many pictures with and of Charity, with captions like “mine” and “my …” There were also reports of other dancers walking in on the two seemingly hooking up, and when asked, Selena even singled out Charity as one of her “girl-crushes.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Beyond this, in 2019, Selena and one of her best friends, Julia Michaels, shared pics of getting matching tattoos and kissing on the lips. Some fans were like, “Wow, this is such a cute friendship,” while other fans, especially Selena’s LGBTQ+ fanbase, were like, “People would 100 percent speculate about a relationship if Julia was a guy.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>They kiss on stage<br>Some: they just friends<br>They get tattoos, Selena says "My arrow points to you forever"<br>Some: They just friends!<br>Selena's captioned: "My love, my heart and my soul" for her.<br>Some: They just friends!<br>Lady Gaga smiles at Bradley Cooper<br>Same People: They banging! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/v29036onZ3</a></p>— MMJ3DX🔞 (@Mmj3D) <a href=#>November 13, 2019</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Selena’s fans are really hoping she is bisexual.</h2><p>In today’s world, identity has become an extremely important part of casting. For the most part, this is because people with some sort of societal advantage, whether that be with race, gender, religion, or sexuality, are often cast in characters who come from more disadvantaged communities. This casting practice only perpetuates those disadvantages by taking away opportunities from people who actually come from these communities.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>But Selena isn’t gay.
