The comedian first came up with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TimeSuck</a>,&nbsp;a comedic informational podcast, where he talked about subjects chosen by his listeners including&nbsp;topics&nbsp;like serial killers, historical events, mysteries, and so on. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>His new creation,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Scared To Death</a>,&nbsp;has a collab of him and his wife&nbsp;Lynze Cummins. The addition of his wife to his new venture has brought in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wider audience</a>, even more so than his previous one. With the podcaster's knack for telling ghost stories and&nbsp;Lynze's<span>&nbsp;</span>genuine and engaging reactions, the couple is scaling&nbsp;new heights.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lady Luck by His Side</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span>Timesuck was Cummins' first attempt&nbsp;to share stories with his audience where he either tried to&nbsp;prove or disprove those&nbsp;accounts.&nbsp;</span>Since the first podcast was more of storytelling and fact-based series, he had the major storytelling lead, but his wife wasn't much present.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span>However, with&nbsp;Scared To Death, the lovely duo has come together and created something the fans enjoy, even more so than their first series. The main idea of the series&nbsp;is clear from its name.&nbsp;In it,&nbsp;the comedian and his wife share horror stories that are meant to scare. While fans are engrossed in Cummins' storytelling abilities,&nbsp;his wife's spontaneous and hilarious reactions complement his stories well and keep them equally engaged.</span></p><p><span>Almost all of the fans from the comedian's first podcast, TimeSuck, have</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span> joined </span></a><span>in on his new venture. But in many of their videos, the couple revealed&nbsp;that&nbsp;their newly acquired fan base&nbsp;from the Scared to Death<strong>&nbsp;</strong>rarely knew about their previous one. They even addressed that their latter podcast was growing faster than their first project in its early phase.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Because of their increased fanbase, the couple gave away $41,000 to 80 families who </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>needed </span></a><span>help in&nbsp;December 2020. They raised the&nbsp;amount through their Patreon pages and donations coming in from their fanbase. They additionally donated the amount matching their fan's donation.</span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Deets about the Power Couple</h2><p>In a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">podcast</a> with Stephenie James,&nbsp;the couple came along and shared the story of how they met and how their story unraveled. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>They met in the year 2012 on one of the shows Cummins was doing for&nbsp;Nic<span>kolodeon, where Lynze&nbsp;coincidentally was the stylist. Lynze shared&nbsp;how annoyed she was with Cummins as he was barely cooperating. On the other hand, the podcaster shared&nbsp;how he thought she was cute.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Another coincidence was that he had mistakenly bought a pair of pants that did not belong to him.&nbsp;This then&nbsp;led her to email him about the said pants. <span>The comedian</span> shared&nbsp;that he was over the moon to hear from her and immediately asked her out following the email. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span>Lynze&nbsp;further&nbsp;shared&nbsp;</span>that they clicked automatically, as they shared similar backgrounds. They knew they were a fit.</p><p>In the interview, the couple also talked&nbsp;about how the comedian's kids were a huge part of their marriage and life. He shared that he was thankful for his kids who vibed in with her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5mur3nCrqSmoZ6oeri1xZ6qZqifmbCiv9Nnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdan-cummins-wifes-podcast-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdan-cummins-wifes-podcast-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdan-cummins-wifes-podcast-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdan-cummins-wifes-podcast-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdan-cummins-wifes-podcast-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdan-cummins-wifes-podcast-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./friendlys-wattamelon-roll-discontinued-sherbet-ice-cream.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./friendlys-wattamelon-roll-discontinued-sherbet-ice-cream.html>Friendly's fans mourn discontinued frozen treat that was perfect for every summer cookout and get to</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chelsea-limited-edition-champions-league-kit.html>Chelsea fans slam 'embarrassing' limited edition kit celebrating Champions League triumph after disc</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./chelsea-limited-edition-champions-league-kit.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
