Each suicide or homicide is a personal tragedy and we know the devastating impact they can have on families and communities."</p><p>Sun Online tried to contact the under-fire Trust but they could not provide a spokesperson over the weekend.</p><p>One of the patients released from Oxleas, which provides specialist care at 125 sites in the capital, is Daniel Atkins.</p><p>He beat his neighbour Ronald Parsons, 71, to death at his flat in Bromley, south-east London two days after he was discharged from Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict0003808993252.jpg><p>Daniel was diagnosed with a schizo-affective disorder but later became a "poster boy" for the Trust as an example of a mental health patient who could function healthily in society.</p><p>But the Mail reports Atkins had himself told hospital staff that he was not ready for life in the outside world - and his mother reportedly said he was too sick to be discharged.</p><p>It is understood that an internal investigation by Oxleas found that the killing of Parsons "could not have been predicted".</p><p>Another victim, retired midwife Priscilla Edward, was strangled to death by her 53-year-old daughter Regina Edwards in 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000378555847.jpg><p>Edwards, 53, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter on ground of diminished responsibility, also suffered from schizo-affective disorder.</p><p>And in 2011, Nicola Edgington tried to decapitate grandmother Sally Hodkin with a meat cleaver in Bexleyheath after she was allowed to leave the Trust's Bracton branch.</p><p>These cases at Oxleas come to light amid anger over the release of "Black Cab rapist" John Worboys.</p><p>Psychologist Jackie Craissati, whose report allegedly contributed to his release, is believed to have worked for Oxleas.</p><p>She was based at its Bracton Centre from 1988 and at the helm as clinical director from 2010 to 2016.</p><p>In 1999, the Journal of Forensic Psychiatry found that two-thirds of schizophrenia patients at Bracton with — 41 out of 63 — went on to re-offend within ten years of being discharged.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfaoF0gpdxaGhpaGK9tMXCoaCarKKesG68wK2gnqakqHqzscuemKydlGKvunnToZxmq5Gism66x6xkraqlqMFurculZLCdnql6sLqMraZmo5mhuXA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f18-psychiatric-patients-released-by-the-same-nhs-trust-all-went-on-to-kill.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f18-psychiatric-patients-released-by-the-same-nhs-trust-all-went-on-to-kill.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f18-psychiatric-patients-released-by-the-same-nhs-trust-all-went-on-to-kill.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f18-psychiatric-patients-released-by-the-same-nhs-trust-all-went-on-to-kill.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f18-psychiatric-patients-released-by-the-same-nhs-trust-all-went-on-to-kill.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f18-psychiatric-patients-released-by-the-same-nhs-trust-all-went-on-to-kill.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./song-joong-ki-song-hye-kyo-affair-rumors-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./song-joong-ki-song-hye-kyo-affair-rumors-html.html>Both Song Joong-ki and Song Hye-kyo Got Surrounded by Extra-Marital Affair Rumors Following Their Di</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-maddie-dean-dating.html>Who is Maddie Dean Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-maddie-dean-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
