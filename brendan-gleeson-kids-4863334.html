But, after the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>95th Academy Awards</a> on Sunday, Mar. 12, he might be known as an Oscar winner. Brendan is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Colm Doherty in The Banshees of Inisherin. The black tragicomedy – written, co-produced, and directed by <strong>Martin McDonagh</strong> – scored nine nominations at the 2023 Oscars: Best Supporting Actor (Gleeson and <strong>Barry Keoghan</strong>), Best Actor (<strong>Colin Farrell</strong>), Best Supporting Actress (<strong>Kerry Condon</strong>), Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Score, Best Film Editing, and Best Original Screenplay.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“It’s a total accident where you’re born,” Gleeson told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Indiewire</a> about the Irish nature of the film and how the characters walk a fine line between authenticity and stereotype. “However, I’ve never seen it as more than a unifying way for people to express themselves. … “I didn’t know who I was supposed to be. I finally came up with the idea that the easiest way to be was that I could be kind of a version of myself. … I like embracing my Irishness because it helps me express myself.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>When he is not working hard on set, he is spending time with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his family</a>. Brendan, who has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>been married</a> to <strong>Mary Gleeson</strong> since 1982, has a total of four sons! Here is everything you need to know about the Gleeson men.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brendan-Gleesons-Kids-shutter-embed-1.jpg><h2>Domhnall Gleeson</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>The eldest of the Gleeson gang is <strong>Domhnall Gleeson</strong>, 39, who was born on May 12, 1983. The Dublin-born man is also an actor <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>like his papa</a>! Domhnall has starred in many hit TV shows and movies including About Time,&nbsp;Goodbye Christopher Robin,&nbsp;The Revenant,&nbsp;and more. Some of his famous costars over the years have included&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Margot Robbie</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rachel McAdams</strong></a>, and others.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>But of all his roles, Domhnall might be mostly known for his role as Bill Weasley in the 2010 film <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a>. However, his most recent work is starring in the thriller series The Patient&nbsp;alongside <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Steve Carell</strong></a>. He has also spent time working in theatre. In fact, in Nov. 2021, he starred in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the play</a> Medicine,&nbsp;which he spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a> about. When asked what theatre gives him that other mediums don’t, he said, “What happens in the theater, the live connection is paramount. That crackle when the work is good, there’s nothing like it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brendan-Gleesons-Kids-shutter-embed-2.jpg><h2>Fergus Gleeson</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>Fergus Gleeson</strong>, 38, is the more private son of Brendan and Mary. He has also dabbled a bit in entertainment, but much less so than his other siblings. His IMDb page contains only two credits: one for composing and one for acting in the 2012 movie Immaturity for Charity.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Brendan’s second son is also a musician. Fergus and his papa have even bonded over their mutual talents during an episode of Ireland’s The Late Late Show in 2020. Both of them <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>performed</a> several songs together in front of host <strong>Ryan Tubridy</strong>, including the song “Queen’s Hornpipe.”</p><h2>Brian Gleeson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brendan-Gleesons-Kids-shutter-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Brian Gleeson</strong>, 35, was born to his proud parents on November 14, 1987. And like his dad and Domhnall, Brian has also pursued a career in acting. He has appeared in both movies and TV shows including Frank of Ireland,&nbsp;Hulu’s The Bisexual, Rebellion,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Death of a Ladies’ Man. Brian has also spent time working in theatre, and in 2022 he returned to the stage for the play A Whistle in the Dark at the Abbey.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“I always wanted the learning experience of going back to theatre,” he told the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Business Post</a> at the time. “It’s kind of scary. I still don’t know how I’d be able to tackle Shakespeare or something. But with Irish stuff, I feel I have a connection with the material, and that obviously helps. It’s something I feel that I can do.”</p><h2>Rory Gleeson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brendan-Gleesons-Kids-shutter-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>Brendan’s youngest son is <strong>Rory Gleeson</strong>, who was born in 1989. The 34-year-old also works in entertainment but in a more behind-the-scenes capacity. Rory is a novelist, playwright, and screenwriter, according to his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>official website</a>. He attended Trinity College Dublin where he earned a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. The youngest Gleeson son then went on to attend Oxford, The University of Manchester, and UEA.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Rory published his first novel, ROCKADOON SHORE,&nbsp;in 2017, a year before his short film, PSYCHIC, premiered at the Galway Film Fleadh. Rory shares the passion for theatre with his brothers Brian and Domhnall, as his debut play Blood in the Dirt, premiered in Nov. 2019. In 2017, Rory spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Guardian</a> about his goal for writing. “I wanted to write a book about young people that doesn’t end with a car crash or an overdose. I didn’t want to start killing them, Cabin in the Woods-style, with horror tropes everywhere, because that’s how so many books about young people end,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GrnKeckaN6qLjEnqqopl2gtqW%2FjG1vb2tjaIFw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrendan-gleeson-kids-4863334.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbrendan-gleeson-kids-4863334.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbrendan-gleeson-kids-4863334.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbrendan-gleeson-kids-4863334.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrendan-gleeson-kids-4863334.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrendan-gleeson-kids-4863334.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./freddie-highmore-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./freddie-highmore-wife.html>Meet the Lucky Woman Who Stole Freddie Highmore's Heart: Details on His Wife</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kiera-mcnally-19900716-html.html>Kiera McNally (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kiera-mcnally-19900716-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
