<time>18 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Due to health reasons, Ozzy Osbourne has announced his retirement from touring. On his social media platforms, he announced the cancellation of his forthcoming European tour. Osbourne said that he was in an accident a few years ago that ruined his spine. He continued, stating that he had been attempting to return to the stage:</p><p>“My singing voice is in good shape. My body is still physically weak despite three surgeries, stem cell therapies, innumerable physical therapy sessions, and, most recently, the revolutionary Cybernics (HAL) Treatment.”</p><p>Ozzy said that he is thankful to his fans for buying tickets for the event, but for the time being, he believes that canceling the tour would be better for him since his medical difficulties have not been resolved. He, like his supporters, said that the choice has had a significant impact on him. He went on to say:</p><p>“I never expected that my traveling days would end in this manner. My team is presently brainstorming locations where I can perform without having to go from city to city and nation to country.”</p><p>Osbourne concluded his speech by thanking everyone, especially his friends and followers, for their love and support during the day. He also said that anybody who bought the tickets might receive a refund at the location where they obtained the passes.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ozzy-Osbourne-1.jpg alt="Ozzy Osbourne" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Ozzy Osbourne collapsed at home In 2019.</h2><p>Ozzy Osbourne was injured after falling at his home in 2019, forcing him to miss a handful of his live gigs. The canceled tours have been rescheduled for 2020.&nbsp;After the incident, Osbourne had to have surgery, and his injuries worsened as a consequence of a bike accident that occurred in 2003. Following the bike accident, he suffered a shattered neck vertebra, as well as a broken collarbone and six ribs. At the time, Ozzy was brought to Wexham Park Hospital and had surgery to raise his collarbone, which was claimed to be resting in an artery and causing issues with blood flow to his arm. The injuries, however, were not life-threatening.</p><p>The event occurred when Osbourne was on leave from work and at home in Buckinghamshire. He was also shooting for the MTV program The Osbournes at the time, and a channel spokesman indicated that they were unaware of how his injury might affect the show’s production.<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ozzy-Osbourne-2.jpg alt="Ozzy Osbourne" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Ozzy Osbourne is well-known for being a founding member of the Black Sabbath.</h2><p>Ozzy Osbourne rose to prominence as a founding member of the rock band Black Sabbath.
