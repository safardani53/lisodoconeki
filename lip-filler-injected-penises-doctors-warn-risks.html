It was so obvious and unnatural looking," he said.</p><p>"It made me very depressed. I was like, what have I done? I've ruined something that I should not have messed with."</p><p>Paul was able to get the botched procedure corrected at Dallas-based cosmetic clinic PhalloFILL, which completes penis filler procedures using hyaluronic acid.</p><p>During the 30-minute treatment, patients are numbed with shots of local anesthetic, and then dermal filler is injected underneath the penis’s top layer of skin.</p><p>There is typically some bruising and swelling right after the procedure.</p><p>Paul told DailyMail.com that the corrective procedure radically changed his sex life for the better.</p><p>Felllow Texan Jordan Tunnell, 33, also out the procedure after years of feeling insecure about his penis size.</p><p>The structural engineer said he's tried using a penis pump after feeling partners weren't sexually satisfied, with little results.</p><p>After getting penile fillers at PhalloFILL, Jordan said his was now more of a 'shower' - it used a shrink a lot - and his sensitivity has increased.</p><p>He even convinced a few friends to get it done themselves, he added.</p><p>In the US, where Paul and Jordan got their procedures done, filler is cleared for use in lips by the Food and Drug Administration, but providers use it off-label for penile injections.</p><p>While penis fillers can be reversed with a dissolving injection, there is limited research in the risks involved in injecting them in this location.</p><p>Like with facial fillers, solution that is inexpertly injected into or around an artery could cause tissue to die.</p><p>And in the first week after enlargement injections, there is also the risk of filler migration, where the filler moves from the original injection site, resulting in an irregular shape or feel.</p><p>If the filler is not applied correctly, it can also harden and leave permanent disfigurement, or the injection sites may get infected.</p><p>Private clinic <a href=# aria-label="International Andrology London (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Andrology London</a> said: that while lumping or migration is unusual for filler used to smooth wrinkles is unusual due to the small amounts administered, "this is not necessarily the case for penis enlargement".</p><p>"Firstly, quite a lot of filler is required (10 to 40ml depending on the penis size) and also since the penis changes shape and size during sexual activity, the risk of lumping or migration is considerable."</p><p>It also added that results from the procedure could fade as early as six months afterwards, adding that most of its patients have filler top-ups one a year.</p><p>Andrology charges between £500 for 10ml of filler, to £2500 for 20ml, depending on the brand used.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=# aria-label="Androfil (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Androfil</a> priced its penis filling between £1750 to £2800, depending on the filler quality.</p><p>Various clinics in the UK offer non-surgical penis filler procedures, using hyaluronic acid or synthetic fillers.</p><p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=#>NHS</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=#>average adult penis size</a>&nbsp;is usually between 3in (8.5cm) and 4in (10.5cm) long when soft, and 6in (15cm) to 7in (18cm) when hard.</p><p>Enlargement&nbsp;<a href=#>surgery</a>&nbsp;is available on the NHS, but only if you have a&nbsp;<a href=#>micro-penis</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>This is one that is less than 3in (8.5cm) in length when erect.</p><p>If you pay privately, it can cost anywhere from £1,000 to £6,000 or more,&nbsp;<a href=#>Superdrug</a>&nbsp;says.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">How to get a bigger penis</h3></p><p>THOUGH most people will attest to the fact that 'size doesn't matter', many men still 'size' up their penis.</p><p>But let's face it, some of these options might include surgery, and the thought of putting your soldier under the knife can be a scary one.</p><p>According to the NHS, there are ways to make your member look bigger without the pain.</p><li><strong>Trim your pubes</strong>&nbsp;- you've heard the saying "mow the lawn to make the tree look bigger", well that's exactly what trimming your pubic hair will do.</li><li><strong>Banish the beer belly</strong>&nbsp;- losing weight is a great way to make your todger look bigger.
