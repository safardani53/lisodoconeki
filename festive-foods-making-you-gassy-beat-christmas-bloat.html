<time>30 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>CHRISTMAS is a time many us allow ourselves to eat to our heart's content.</p><p>Our <a href=#>day of indulgence</a> might leave us in some discomfort.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/christmas-dinner-served-table-vegetables-786453106.jpg><p>With a rich array of <a href=#>treats and sweets</a> to chose from, you might have eaten a bit more than your stomach could take, and who can blame you?</p><p>But that feeling of your waistband cutting into your middle could also be caused by <a href=#>gas</a> and <a href=#>bloating</a>.</p><p>One component of our Christmas lunch is often vilified as the cause of this - this is none other than humble <a href=#>sprout</a>.</p><p>It's easy to blame the pungent little vegetable for our stomach troubles, but consultant dietitian Kirsten Jackson told Sun Health there could be more to your <a href=#>Christmas bloat.</a></p><p>"The main issues with Christmas foods and and digestive health is the sheer volume of food," she said.</p><p>"Often we want to blame a specific food but actually we have just overindulged."</p><p>Overeating aside, Kirsten - known as the <a href=# aria-label="IBS Dietitian (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">IBS Dietitian</a> on socials - said it's also worth looking at what's on our plate to explain our discomfort.</p><p>She acknowledged that Brussels sprouts can in fact leave some of us feeling gassy, as they contain a lot of fructans.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>This "is a type of carbohydrate that is broken down by our gut bacteria," the dietitian explained.</p><p>"This process is actually very beneficial for our overall health but it does involve a lot of gas products," Kirsten noted.</p><p>"Everyone has different tolerance levels to fructans, so some people may not have any issues at all whilst others could be quite sensitive."</p><p>Here are five other festive foods that could leave you feeling gassy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Yorkshire puddings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/freshly-cooked-yorkshire-puddings-sunday-724252816.jpg><p>Kirsten's first addition to the list of foods that could leave your tummy swollen is the beloved <a href=#>Yorkshire pud</a>.</p><p>A roast dinner staple outside of Christmas, these crispy little gravy boats could be causing you some discomfort, the dietitian said.</p><p>Like sprouts, Yorkshires also contain fructans.</p><p>This is due to their wheat content, as they tend to be made with flour.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Gravy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wooden-spoon-saucepan-filled-hot-859803832.jpg><p>Speaking of <a href=#>gravy</a>, the thick sauce that brings our roast together could also be the culprit behind your Christmas bloat, Kirsten added.</p><p>It's yet another food that contains fructans, according to the dietitian, due to its onion and garlic content.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Honey glazed parsnips</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/roasted-root-vegetables-white-dish-783344487.jpg><p>A Christmas roast never feels complete without a vegetable accompaniment and many people choose <a href=#>parsnips</a> as theirs.</p><p>But if you're glazing your parsnips with honey, Kirsten warned that they could be causing your stomach to bloat.</p><p>That's because honey is high in <a href=#>fructose</a>, "a type of sugar you would typically associate with being in fruit", the dietitian said.</p><p>Fructose won't cause problems for everyone.</p><p>But "if your tolerance level is lower then the fructose overwhelms your small bowel and goes undigested into your large bowel, which again can create gas", the dietitian explained.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Christmas pudding</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/burning-christmas-pudding-tall-single-784302324.jpg><p>Many families will draw their feast to a close with a gooey <a href=#>Christmas pudding</a>.</p><p>But this is yet another festive staple that's high in carbohydrates, which can create more gas, Kirsten went on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Chocolate and cream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/big-mix-chocolate-candies-white-855882181-4.jpg><p>If you're more of the type to indulge in deserts with <a href=#>chocolate</a> and cream, the bad <span id=d60cefab-39bb-400f-ad93-a6c72278a525 class=suggested-link>news</span> is these can also fill your stomach with gas.</p><p>This unpleasant side effect is due to the foods' lactose content.</p><p>As Kirsten explained: "<a href=#>Lactose intolerance</a> is very common, but even someone with a lactose intolerance can usually tolerate a small amount of lactose with no issues - such as some cream on a pudding or a scoop of ice-cream.</p><p>"But at Christmas we can sometimes have lots of high lactose which can overwhelm some people's guts."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>HOW TO BEAT YOUR CHRISTMAS BLOAT</h2><p>It turns out, our Christmas feasts are littered with foods that could be leaving us bloated and uncomfortable.</p><p>But according to Kirsten, there are a few ways feel less bloated when indulging in all the rich foods customary for this time of year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Stick to 3 meals a day</h2><p>It can be be easy to keep grazing on treats and chocolates between meals during Christmastime.</p><p>Others "will not eat for long <span id=581a97a5-7310-4b51-a2d3-045a31940bf5 class=suggested-link>periods</span> of time and then overindulge&nbsp;in a Christmas dinner because they are so hungry," the dietitian noted.</p><p>But Kirsten recommended you "try and stick to a routine of having three main meals per day, with a reasonable snack if needed".</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Portion size is key</h2><p>Kirsten recommended: "If you know particular foods cause issues, try having them but in smaller portions.</p><p>"My clients are often surprised by how many foods they can tolerate when they take this approach," she added.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Use digestive enzymes</h2><p>The dietitian suggested using specific digestive enzymes to ease your bloat.</p><p>"Lactase is useful to break down the lactose in dairy products for you if you have an intolerance and alpha-galactosidase is useful for those foods which contain onion and garlic," she said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lay off the alliums</h2><p>"Try reducing your intake of onion and garlic," Kirsten recommended.</p><p>"These foods are difficult to digestive for most people so simple swaps like making your own gravy to avoid these ingredients could help."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Don't forget fibre</h2><p>"Many festive foods contain little to no fibre," Kirsten pointed out.</p><p>Leaving this key nutrient out of our diets can have more of an effect than you think.</p><p>"This can cause <a href=#>our gut to slow down</a> causing us to be more uncomfortable," the dietitian explained.</p><p>"Good sources of fibre include vegetables and whole-grains like oats and brown rice.</p><p>"So you could think of easy wins like eating oats cakes with cheese rather than white crackers or simply having half or a third of your plate made up with vegetables during your main meals."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Move between meals</h2><p>How many of us have spent most of Christmas lounging on the couch?</p><p>It's easier than you think to forget to exercise during the holidays.</p><p>But being less active can actually slow your gut down and make you feel even more uncomfortable, Kirsten told Sun Health.</p><p>"Instead consider going for a gentle winter walk or taking 20 mins out for yourself to practise some&nbsp;yoga," she suggested.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Limit your alcohol intake</h2><p>It's no secret that the festive season can get pretty boozy.</p><p>As Kirsten said: "It's very common in British culture to start drinking at breakfast with the bucks fizz.</p><p>"I hate to play scrooge here but alcohol is a drug which can cause digestive symptoms."</p><p>That doesn't mean you can indulge in drinks at all though.</p><p>"You don't need to be t-total but do consider drinking later in the day, switching between alcohol and non alcoholic drinks and having a supply of appetising non-alcoholic alternatives," Kirsten recommended.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>WHEN SHOULD I BE WORRIED ABOUT MY BLOATING?</h2><p>While bloating over the holidays is super common, but it's worth talking to a doctor about if it's persistent.</p><p>As Kirsten explained, "bloating&nbsp;now and again is pretty normal".</p><p>"If&nbsp;bloating&nbsp;is regular then someone should go to the doctors to be checked," she explained.</p><p>"Bloating&nbsp;can be a symptom of coeliac disease, <a href=#>irritable bowel syndrome</a> and even some <a href=#>cancers</a>."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The NHS advises you see a GP if:</p><ul><li>You've been feeling bloated for three weeks or more</li><li>You feel bloated regularly -
